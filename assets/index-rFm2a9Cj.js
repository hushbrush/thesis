She soon becomes an imperial favorite, but also Genji's childhood crush and later lifelong obsession. By chapter seven, “Momiji no ha,” it becomes obvious that Fujitsubo and Genji are already involved in an illicit love affair (although the author does not describe, but rather implies the beginning of the relationship), the result of which is the birth of Reizei (future emperor) whom everyone, except the two lovers, believes to be the son of the Kiritsubo Emperor. Elevated to the rank of Empress and having her son named Heir Apparent (Reizei is supposed to succeed Suzaku), Fujitsubo gradually grows more and more troubled by guilt and the fear of having her secret exposed. Once Genji's advances intensify and, in the public realm, the faction of the Kokiden Lady comes to power, Fujitsubo's only countermeasure is to take vows and become a nun (“Sakaki”). By this, she hopes on the one hand, to permanently put Genji off and eliminate the risk of their affair being discovered and, on the other hand, to reassure Kokiden that she renounces any secular, political claims to power. After Genji's return from exile, she forms a political alliance with him and turns into a genuine “politically ambitious” [ 2 ] : 30 figure in the tale. Only on her deathbed (in “Usugumo”) does she return to being a romantic heroine. [ 2 ] : 44 Nevertheless, Fujitsubo's importance in the tale lies beyond her immediate contribution to the plot, in what Norma Field termed as being an “original substitute” [ 2 ] : 24 (she makes her debut as a substitute for Kiritsubo, yet, later, Genji will look for substitutes for her, in women such as Utsusemi, the Third Princess, but most of all, in Murasaki).

She attracts Genji's attention, but resists his courtship despite his repeated attempts to win her over. Although she will not become a central character in the tale, Utsusemi is memorable as the first woman Genji courts in the tale and whose courtship the readers actually witness and also, arguably, as the first to resist him (chapters 2,3,4; reenters the tale in chapter 16; is mentioned again in chapter 23). A lady of lower rank, after the death of her father she has no choice but to become the second wife of the Iyo Deputy, whose first wife is dead at the time of the narrative (Chapter 2 “Hahakigi”). She accidentally attracts Genji's attention during one of his visits to the Governor of Kii's mansion. Forced to avoid a directional taboo, young Genji leaves his father-in-law's mansion at Sanjō and takes refuge to his retainer's house. Ritual purification also forced the women of the Iyo Deputy's household, Utsusemi included, to temporarily reside in the same place. Having heard some feminine voices and the movements in an adjacent room, Genji becomes interested in the Governor's step-mother, whom he already knew was young and potentially attractive. That very same night, Genji steals into the women's quarters and under the guise of being a lady-in-waiting (Utsusemi is calling for Chūjō, which is both the sobriquet of her servant and Genji's current rank of captain), he slips next to Utsusemi. Once the lady realizes who he really is, she is terrified and would like to call for help, were it not for her awareness that such a discovery would only bring her shame. Even so, she still rejects his advances and keeps strong despite his seductive words, until Genji, at a loss, can only think of taking her away to a more private location. As he carries her out of the room, he encounters the real Chūjō who is more than ready to defend her mistress against this unknown intruder until she too realizes who he is. Genji's rank and status is simply too high for the two women to dare raise a commotion. Once Genji secures Utsusemi's location, he continues to pour out sweet words and promises, yet the lady “was as (...) the young bamboo: she bent but was not to be broken.” [ 6 ] Despite the textual description, many Genji critics read the incident as Genji's success despite the lady's resistance. Their interpretation lies heavily on one verb in the original, miru , which, although has multiple meanings, also refers to “making love, carnally knowing someone.” Because of this one meaning among many, the traditional interpretation of the scene was that Genji does manage to break through Utsusemi's defenses and ends up sleeping with her. Other critics however, most prominently Margaret Childs, [ 7 ] prefer to reject this interpretation as unfounded. After the incident in question, Genji tries to see the lady two more times. The first time, she finds out about his arrival and takes refuge into another wing of the house, where she surrounds herself with her ladies-in-waiting. Frustrated, Genji ends up taking her younger brother to bed, as her replacement. This episode is considered the sole explicit example of homosexual relations in the tale. The second time, Genji manages to get close to her and he even gets to spy on her playing go with her step-daughter, Nokiba no ogi . This kaimami (man spying on one or multiple women through a gap in the fence/ curtain/ screen) became a favorite screen among Genji artists and has been often illustrated as representation for chapter 3 “Utsusemi.” After having spied on her, Genji, with the complicity of Utsusemi's younger brother, Kogimi, steals into her chamber again. Aware of his presence, Utsusemi manages to escape from Genji's embrace by discarding her outer robe like a cicada discards its shell (hence the chapter title). In her desire to escape him, the lady also abandons behind her sleeping step-daughter, who becomes Genji's unwitting prey. Unwilling to admit defeat, or rather to sleep alone for the night, Genji makes do with what is left behind and ends sleeping with Nokiba no ogi, who does not even imagine she has been the victim of mistaken identity. At the end of the fourth chapter, \\"Yugao\\", Utsusemi leaves the capital with her husband who has been appointed governor of a province. Nokiba no ogi also gets married and leaves the narrative. Utsusemi returns in chapter sixteen, “Sekiya,” when she meets Genji on her return from the provinces. They exchange poems, and Utsusemi is shown to regret not being able to accept Genji's advances (because of Utsusemi's marriage and differences in rank). Last time the readers encounter Utsusemi is in chapter twenty-three, “Hatsune,” where they learn that she has become a nun after her husband's death. The reason behind her decision is her desire to escape the unwelcome amorous attentions of her step-son, the Governor of Kii. After taking the tonsure, Utsusemi comes to depend upon Genji and takes residence in his former home (his home before the building of the Rokujō-in), Nijō-in.","normalized_title":"Tale Of

affair in the eponymous chapter four, “Yūgao.” Before encountering Genji, Yūgao was Tō no Chūjō's mistress and even gave him a daughter, the future Tamakazura. However, because of the jealousy of Tō no Chūjō's main wife, Yūgao leaves him and goes into hiding. It is under these circumstances that Genji encounters her, while out visiting his former wet nurse (Koremitsu's mother). The woman's name translates as “Evening Faces” and refers to the flowers that attract Genji's attraction to Yūgao's shabby abode. Genji becomes very fond of this woman, of whom he apparently knows next to nothing, and proceeds to move her to an abandoned mansion where she falls prey to spirit possession and dies. The possessing spirit is traditionally associated with Lady Rokujō.

of high birth and Genji's senior by seven years. Introduced in the tale narrative in chapter four, “Yūgao,” as Genji's lover, Rokujō is not mentioned in any of the previous chapters. Nevertheless, the later narrative does clarify certain biographical aspects related to this lady. Thus, she is the widow of a former Crown Prince (presumably one of Emperor Kiritsubo's brothers) and would have become an empress, if not for her husband's untimely death. Because of her outstanding social position, she is entitled to be treated with the utmost respect, a fact which Genji, too caught up in his philandering, neglects to do. Humiliated by Genji's disrespect for her, angered and jealous by the rumors of his affairs, Rokujō becomes the perfect candidate for being the possessing spirit behind Yūgao's demise, at least in traditional interpretations of the tale. Her identification as possessing spirit is further reinforced in the “Aoi” chapter, where several clues seem to make her the culprit in Aoi's possession and death. Troubled by the gossip about her involvement in Aoi's possession, Rokujō herself comes to believe in her own guilt. As a result, she decides to follow her daughter, appointed as Priestess, to Ise. After her return to the capital, she entrusts her daughter, Akikonomu, to Genji and dies in chapter fourteen, “Miotsukushi.” Following her death, she keeps being identified as the spirit inflicting torment upon Genji's women, Murasaki and the Third Princess to be exact.

She makes her debut into the tale as a substitute for her unattainable aunt, but she gradually outshines Fujitsubo in Genji's and the readers’ eyes, turning into “a substitute for all seasons.” [ 2 ] : 160 In fact, her very name, “Murasaki” translated as “Lavender,” plays on the similarity of two colors (the color “murasaki” is purple of a darker hue than “fuji”, wisteria, of Fujitsubo's name). Discovered by Genji in the Northern Hills when she is only ten, she is taken into his Nijō residence after the death of her grandmother (the episode of her kidnapping has definite violent undertones) where she is molded into Genji's ideal woman, not unlike the myth of Galatea, with whom she is often compared. [ 8 ] She remains Genji's most important lover throughout the tale, but, because of her imperfect social status (she is of royal blood on her father's side, but her mother was a commoner), she can never be acknowledged as Genji's main wife (kita no kata). For that reason, her position is perpetually insecure, especially when Genji's attention shifts to other women including Akashi, Asagao, but most importantly, the Third Princess. Childless her entire life, Murasaki can only adopt Genji's daughter by the Akashi Lady and raise her to become an empress. Towards the end of her life, she repeatedly expresses her desire to become a nun, but meets Genji's resolute opposition. She becomes the victim of spirit possession in chapter 35 (the aggressor is once more identified as Rokujō, though this interpretation has been debated [ 5 ] ) and dies in chapter 40 without having realized her wish. Murasaki as a character of the Genji has triggered much debate among scholars. Some see her as an utterly miserable character, [ 8 ] while others claim that her relationship with Genji is the best things that could have happened to a woman of Murasaki's status. [ 9 ] The beauty of this character resides precisely in its complexity.

Saam agrees but goes to the court of Manuchehr for permission. In Kabul, Mihrab, hearing about what had transpired between Zal and Rudabeh, becomes very angry and wants to kill his daughter; his wife, Sindukht, intervenes.When Zal comes to the court of Manuchehr, he is ordered to invade Kabul. Hearing this news, Mihrab becomes angry again, and again he wants to kill his wife and his daughter. Rudabeh calms her father down. Then, she herself goes to Saam and discusses the matter with him. Zal, too, goes to Saam and requests that rather than invade Kabul, he (Zal) should be killed. Consequently, Saam dispatches Zal with a letter to Manuchehr. After consulting with his astrologers, Manuchehr approves the marriage between Zal and Rudabeh. Rustam is born from this marriage. The birth is a difficult one (see Rustam, Simurgh, Zal, for further details).After the death of Rustam, Rudabeh loses consciousness but soon after, with loving care, she returns to good health. After the death of Faramarz, Rudabeh curses the House of Gushtasp. Pashutan, Gushtasp's son and the minister of Bahman, who had killed Faramarz, is filled with fear at Rudabeh's curse. He requests from Bahman to forgive the family of Zal and allow Rustam's family to return to Zabulistan.","normalized_title":"Shahnameh","title":"Shahnameh","author":"Abolqasem

of prowess and patience and courage and high fame ' 'o king i am frightened do thou o virtuous one comfort me ' 'engaged in the worship of the gods devoted to the twice born ones the guardian of the

kingdom his defeat at the hands of his own kinsmen this separation from my lord and my son and daughter this my unprotected state and my presence in this forest abounding in innumerable beasts of prey ' 'alas what misdeed have i perpetrated ' 'nothing that befalleth men is due to anything else than destiny for even in my childhood i did not commit any such sin in thought word or deed whence might come this calamity ' 'and she entered that excellent city clad in half a garment ' 'and beholding her enter the city of the king of the chedis the boys of the city from curiosity began to follow her ' 'and from the terrace the queen mother saw her surrounded by the crowd ' 'i accompanied my husband into the woods comforting the hero clad in a single piece of cloth and maniac like and overwhelmed with calamity ' 'methinks i suffer this severance from my husband through the potency of those celestial _lokapalas_ who had come to the swayamvara but whom i disregarded for the sake of nala ' 'o she

damayanti the venerable queen became filled with sorrow ' o beautiful one my house is to thee even as thy father's and this wealth o damayanti is thine as much as mine unrecognised i have still lived

answer ' damayanti oppressed with grief and distress calling sudeva addressed him o yudhishthira in the presence of her mother saying 'o sudeva go thou to the city of ayodhya ' 'a beautious and virtuous woman should not be angry with one that was deprived by birds of his garment while striving to procure sustenance and who is being consumed with grief ' hearing these words of his i have speedily come here thou hast now heard all do what thou thinkest proper and inform the king of it damayanti with tearful eyes came to her mother and spake unto her in private 'o mother king bhima

purpose ' 'indeed that girl of slender waist afflicted with grief on my account and with despair will not certainly do anything of the kind when especially she is the mother of offspring by me ' and damayanti said 'because the rattle of his car filling the whole earth gladdens my heart it must be king nala that has come if i do not see nala of face bright as the moon that hero with countless virtues i shall certainly die if i am not clasped today in that hero's thrilling embrace i shall certainly cease to be 'if naishadha with voice deep as that of the clouds doth not come to me today i shall enter into a pyre of golden brilliance ' 'if that foremost of kings powerful as a lion and gifted with the strength of an infuriated elephant doth not present himself before me i shall certainly cease to live ' from these indications suspecting that vahuka was her husband damayanti once more weepingly addressed kesini in soft words saying 'o beauteous one go thou once more and bring from the kitchen without vahuka's knowledge some meat that hath been boiled and dressed' 'o damayanti ' 'o beauteous one he touched fire and was not burnt and at his will water falling floweth in a stream and i have witnessed another greater wonder still he took up some flowers began to press them slowly with his hands and pressed by his hand the flowers did not lose their original forms but on the contrary became gayer and more odorous than before ' 'and o bharata overwhelmed with grief and washing her face she sent her two children with kesini ' 'having obtained the consent both of her father and mother damayanti caused nala to be brought to her apartments ' with a sorrowful heart and eager to behold nala again despatched kesini to her mother asking her to say on her behalf 'suspecting vahuka to be nala i have tried him in various ways my doubt now only relates to his appearance i intend to examine him myself o mother either let him enter the palace or give me permission to go to him and arrange this with the knowledge of my father or without it ' 'may the all witnessing air that courseth through this world take my life if i have committed any sin may the sun that ever

great beauty like that of sree herself ' 'and she lost all inclination for beds and seats and object of enjoyment ' 'and beholding her uneasy and fallen into that condition her hand maids represented o king the matter of her illness unto the ruler of vidarbha by indirect hints ' and the monarch o exalted one invited all the rulers of the earth saying _ye heroes know that damayanti's swayamvara is at hand_ 'the celebrated damayanti' ye heroes know that damayanti's swayamvara is at hand 'o exalted one the kings of the whole world ' 'the celebrated damayanti' 'and she having frequent sighs she was filled with anxiety and became melancholy and pale faced and lean ' 'and she lost all inclination for beds and seats and object of enjoyment ' ye heroes know that damayanti's swayamvara is at hand

the great indra and the others are coming to the assembly desirous of beholding the swayamvara the gods sakra and agni and varuna and yama desire to obtain thee do thou therefore choose one of them for thy lord ' 'and she seemed to rebuke the light of the moon by her own splendour ' 'o giver of proper honour if thou forsake me who adore thee for thy sake will i resort to poison or fire or water or the rope ' 'and hearing of it all the lords of earth smit with love speedily came thither desirous of possessing damayanti ' 'and damayanti of beauteous face stealing the eyes and hearts of the princes by her dazzling light entered the hall ' 'and beholding them seated there without difference of any kind in form doubt filled her mind and she could not ascertain which of them was king nala ' 'and at whomsoever among them she looked she regarded him to be the king of the nishadhas ' and filled with anxiety the beautious one thought within herself 'oh how shall i distinguish the celestials and how discern the royal nala ' and bowing down unto them with mind and speech with folded hands she addressed them trembling 'since i heard the speech of the swans i chose the king of the nishadhas as my lord for the sake of 'the large eyed damsel then bashfully caught the hem of his garment and placed round his neck a floral wreath of exceeding grace ' 'and after the daughter of bhima had chosen naishadha as her husband and as it is for paying homage unto nala that i have adopted this vow for the sake of that truth o let the gods reveal him unto me ' 'hearing these piteous words of damayanti and ascertaining her fixed resolve and fervent love for the king of nishadhas the purity of her heart and her inclination and regard and affection for nala ' 'the large eyed damsel then bashfully caught the hem of his garment and placed round his neck a floral wreath of exceeding grace ' and the kings also having witnessed with wonder damayanti's selection of nala returned delighted whence they had come 'and when that fair complexioned maiden had thus chosen nala for her husband the kings suddenly broke out into exclamations of _oh _ and _alas _' 'the happy pair beholding agni and the other gods mentally sought their protection and after the daughter of bhima had chosen naishadha as her husband ' and the kings also having witnessed with wonder damayanti's selection of nala

the earth abounding in wealth ' and the kings also having witnessed with wonder damayanti's selection of nala returned delighted whence they had come 'and having attained that pearl of a woman the virtuous king o monarch began to pass his days in joy like the slayer of vala and vritra in the company of sachi ' 'and the high minded king begat upon damayanti a son named indrasena and a daughter named indrasena ' 'thus challenged in the presence of damayanti the lofty minded king could not long decline it ' vrihadaswa said 'bhima's daughter the cool headed damayanti seeing the righteous king maddened and deprived of his senses at dice was filled o king with alarm and grief ' 'o vrihatsena go thou and summon the councillors in the name of nala and tell them also what of wealth and other things hath been lost and what remaineth ' and hearing that the dice were uniformly unfavourable to the virtuous nala and that he had lost everything she again spake unto her nurse saying 'o vrihatsena go thou again in nala's name to bring hither o blessed one the charioteer varshneya ' 'i do not think however that in this the high souled naishadha is to blame in as much as the king regarded not my words being absorbed in play o charioteer i seek thy protection do my behest ' 'even those of mine' 'i do not think however that in this the high souled naishadha is to blame in as

with the fleetness of the mind do thou take these twins my son and daughter on the car and hie thou to kundina 'and leaving there the boy indrasena and the girl indrasena as also that best of cars and those steeds the charioteer with a sad heart grieving for nala bade farewell unto bhima ' 'and damayanti clad in one piece of cloth followed him behind as he was leaving the city ' 'and coming to the outskirts of the city nala stayed there for three nights with his wife and damayanti ' 'o faultless one ' 'o faultless one' 'o timid one' 'o faultless one therefore listen to the words i speak for thy good ' 'o king thinking of thy purpose my heart trembleth and all my limbs become faint ' 'i will o great monarch soothe thy weariness ' 'o slender waisted damayanti it is even as thou hast said ' 'to a man in distress there is no friend or medicine that is equal unto a wife ' 'but i do not seek to renounce thee wherefore o timid one dost thou dread this ' 'o faultless one i can forsake myself but thee i cannot forsake ' 'o king thinking of thy purpose my heart trembleth and all my limbs become faint how can i go leaving thee in the lone woods despoiled of thy kingdom and deprived of thy wealth

they came to a sheltered shed for travellers and arrived at this place the king of the nishadhas sat down on the bare earth with the princess of vidarbha ' 'she is truly devoted to me and suffereth this distress for my sake ' 'devoted as she is to me if she stayeth with me distress will surely be hers while it is doubtful if i desert her ' 'surely thy father's kingdom is as my own but thither i will not by any means repair in this extremity ' 'saying this again and again unto damayanti ' 'and both attired in one cloth and wearing the same piece of cloth with damayanti ' 'and arrived at this

wander to her relatives ' 'but his heart failing him the king of the nishadhas returned to the shed and seeing damayanti again burst into tears ' 'she is truly devoted to me and suffereth this distress for my sake ' 'the daughter of vidharbha' 'oh why hast thou deserted thy accomplished wife ever devoted to thee particularly one that hath not wronged thee though wronged thou hast been by

faultless limbs was struck with amazement ' and she asked herself 'was it a dream that i saw what an occurrence hath taken place where are all those ascetics and where is that asylum where further is that delightful river of sacred waters the resort of diverse kinds of fowls and where again are those charming trees decked with fruits and flowers ' 'and going to another part of the wood she saw an _asoka_ tree and approaching that first of trees in the forest so charming with blossoms and its load of foliage and resounding with the notes of birds damayanti with tears in her eyes and accents choked in grief began to lament saying ' 'and hearing these dreadful words of the merchants damayanti in terror and shame and anxiety fled into the woods apprehensive of evil ' 'the crowd of men that i obtained in this lone forest hath been destroyed by a herd of elephants surely as a consequence of my ill luck ' 'i have heard from old men that no person dieth ere his time it is for this that my miserable self hath not been trodden to death by that herd of elephants ' 'methinks i suffer this severance from my husband through the potency of those celestial wrath of god on me ' 'who had come to the swayamvara but whom i disregarded for the sake of nala ' 'bewailing thus o tiger among kings that excellent lady damayanti devoted to her husband went oppressed with grief and pale as the autumnal moon ' 'and surrounded by them she came before the palace of the king ' 'she hath fallen into distress and standeth in need of succour i find her beauty to be such that it illumineth my house ' 'the fair one though looking like a maniac seemeth a very _sree_ with her large eyes ' 'and struck with wonder o king she asked damayanti saying ' 'tell me who thou art and whose o thou possessed of celestial splendour surely thy beauty is not human bereft though thou art of ornaments ' 'hearing these words of the nurse the daughter of bhima said ' 'know that i am a female belonging to the human species and devoted to my husband i am a serving woman of good lineage i live wherever i like subsisting on fruit and roots and whom a companion and stay where evening overtaketh me ' 'my husband is the owner of countless virtues and was ever devoted to me and i also on my part was deeply attached to him following him like his shadow ' 'thus passed many days until at last while i was sleeping he cut off half of my cloth and forsook me who had done him no wrong ' 'i am seeking my husband but unable to find him who not been trodden to death by that herd of elephants ' 'and beholding her enter the city of the king of the chedis the boys of the city from curiosity began to follow her ' 'she is forlorn and is being vexed by the crowd she hath fallen into distress and standeth in need of succour ' 'the fair one though looking like a maniac seemeth a beauty that illumineth my house ' 'thus remembering damayanti the king of the nishadhas continued to live unknown in the abode of that monarch ' 'do ye search for nala and also for my daughter damayanti ' 'even if failing to bring damayanti and nala here he that succeeds learning their whereabouts will get from me the wealth represented by a thousand kine ' 'and beholding that lady of large eyes soiled and emaciated he decided her to be damayanti coming to that conclusion from various reasons ' 'and beholding that lady of large eyes soiled and emaciated he decided her to be damayanti coming to that conclusion from various reasons ' as i saw her before this damsel is even so at present o i am blest by casting my eyes on

hath swallowed that luminary ' 'indeed this girl of a delicate frame and of lovely limbs ' thus addressed the brahmanas cheerfully went out in all directions seeking nala and his wife but nala or his spouse they found not anywhere until at length searching in the beautiful city of the chedis a brahmana named sudeva during the time of the king's prayers saw the princess of vidarbha in the palace of the king seated with sunanda 'and her incomparable beauty was slightly perceptible like the brightness of a fire enveloped in curls of smoke ' 'and beholding that lady of large eyes soiled and emaciated he decided her to be damayanti coming to that conclusion from various reasons ' 'resembling the full moon of unchanging youth of well rounded breasts illumining all sides by her splendour possessed of large eyes like beautiful lotuses ' 'o princess of vidarbha i am sudeva the dear friend of thy brother i have come here seeking thee at the desire of king bhima ' 'thy father is well and also thy mother and thy brothers and thy son and daughter blessed with length of days are living in peace ' 'o princess of vidarbha recognising sudeva asked him respecting all her relatives and kinsmen one after another ' '_sairindhri_ is weeping bitterly in the presence of a brahmana if thou likest satisfy thyself ' 'widely known by the name of damayanti ' 'this blessed lady is his daughter and widely known by the name of damayanti ' 'this blessed lady is the wife of that wise and righteous monarch ' 'no woman existeth that is her rival in beauty ' 'between the eye brows of this ever

the vidarbhas bhima by name this blessed lady is his daughter and widely known by the name of damayanti ' 'and there is a king ruling the nishadhas named nala the son of virasena this blessed lady is the wife of that wise and righteous monarch ' 'no woman existeth that is her rival in beauty between the eye brows of this ever youthful damsel there is an excellent mole from birth resembling a lotus ' 'placed there by the creator himself as an indication of prosperity and wealth that mole is visible faintly like the cloud covered lunar crescent of the first day of the lighted fortnight ' 'and covered as her body is with dust her beauty hath not disappeared though careless of her person it is still manifest and shineth like gold ' 'o beauteous girl thy mother and i are both daughters of the high souled sudaman the ruler of the dasarnas ' 'she was bestowed upon king bhima and i on viravahu ' i witnessed thy birth at our father's palace in the country of the dasarnas o beautiful one my house is to thee even as thy father's 'and this wealth o damayanti ' o beauteous girl thy mother and i are both daughters of the high souled sudaman the ruler of the dasarnas she was bestowed upon king bhima and i on viravahu i witnessed thy birth at our father's palace in the country of the dasarnas o beautiful one my house is to thee even as thy father's 'o beauteous girl thy mother and i are both daughters of the high souled sudaman the ruler of the dasarnas ' 'unrecognised i have still lived happily with thee every want of mine satisfied and myself cared for by thee ' 'but mother i have

are they passing their days stricken with sorrow 'no woman existeth that is her rival in beauty between the eye brows of this ever youthful damsel there is' 'soon enough she reached the country of the vidarbhas ' and beholding her in that plight all the inmates of the inner apartments broke out into exclamation of '_oh _' and '_alas _' and began to cry bitterly and then the queen addressed the mighty monarch bhima saying 'thy daughter damayanti mourneth on account of her husband nay banishing away all bashfulness she hath herself o king declared her mind to me let thy men strive to find out nala the righteous ' and bhima's daughter spake unto them saying 'do ye cry in every realm and in every assembly 'o beloved gambler where thy mole i find that thou art the daughter of my sister o beauteous girl thy mother and i are both daughters of the high souled sudaman the ruler of the dasarnas ' 'the illustrious damayanti o king worshipped the gods and brahmanas according to the superior method ' and beholding her in that plight all the inmates of the inner apartments broke out into exclamation of '_oh _' and '_alas _' and began to cry bitterly 'o brahmana i will bestow on thee wealth in abundance again thou hast done me the immense service which none else indeed can do me ' 'and thus addressed by damayanti that high minded brahmana comforted her uttering benedictory words of auspicious import ' 'o represser of foes if it is possible for thee go thither without delay tomorrow after the sun hath risen she will choose a second husband as she doth not know whether the heroic nala liveth or not ' 'and addressed by her o monarch thus sudeva set out ' 'when nala will come here o brahmana i will bestow on thee wealth in abundance again ' 'let sudeva without delay go hence to the city of ayodhya for the purpose of bringing nala o mother having performed the same auspicious rites by virtue of which he had speedily brought me into the midst of friends ' 'damayanti also heard the sound of that car driven by nala like the deep roar of the clouds in the rainy season ' 'hearing everything damayanti became oppressed with grief' 'thus addressed by damayanti kesini went away ' 'she related unto damayanti all that had happened indeed everything of human and super human that she had witnessed in vahuka ' o beauteous one go thou once more and bring from the kitchen without vahuka's knowledge some meat that hath been boiled and dressed by him 'thus commanded kesini ever bent on doing what was agreeable to damayanti went to vahuka and taking some hot meat come thou and tell me and whatever human or super human thou seest in vahuka together with anything else should all be reported unto me ' 'and thus addressed by damayanti kesini went away and having marked the conduct of that person versed in horse lore she came back ' 'o fair damsel' 'o beauteous one' o beauteous one go thou once more and bring from the kitchen without vahuka's knowledge some meat that hath been boiled and dressed by him 'thus commanded kesini gave that meat o son of the kuru race unto damayanti ' 'and she thereupon decided vahuka to be nala and wept aloud in grief of heart ' 'o fair damsel these twins are very like my own children beholding them unexpectedly i shed tears if thou comest to me frequently people may think evil for we are guests from another land therefore o blessed one go at thy ease ' 'that best of women damayanti also upon beholding king nala in that condition was sorely afflicted with grief ' 'o vahuka hast thou ever seen any person acquainted with duty who hath gone away deserting his sleeping wife in the forest who except the virtuous nala could go away deserting in the woods his dear and unoffending wife overcome with fatigue ' 'o timid one neither the loss of my kingdom nor my desertion of thee was my act both were due to kali and o foremost of virtuous women lamenting for me day and night and overcome with sorrow thou hadst in the woods cursed kali and so he began to dwell in my body burning in consequence of thy curse indeed burning with thy curse he lived within me like fire within fire o blessed girl that our sorrows might terminate that wretch have i overcome by my observances and austerities the sinful wretch hath already left me and it is for this that i have come hither my presence here o fair lady is for thy sake i have no other object ' 'it behoveth thee not o blessed one to suspect any fault in me o ruler of the nishadhas passing over the celestials themselves i choose thee as my lord ' 'when thou hadst returned a fit answer to those words of his it was then o naishadha that i devised this scheme to recover thee ' 'it behoveth thee not o blessed one to suspect any fault in me o ruler of the nishadhas passing over the celestials themselves i choose thee as my lord ' 'at last o king a learned brahmana named parnada had found thee in kosala in the palace of rituparna when thou hadst returned a fit answer to those words of his it was then o naishadha that i devised this scheme to recover thee ' 'let the three gods that sustain the triple worlds in their entirety declare truly or let them forsake me today ' 'of this we are the witnesses as we have been her protectors for these three years ' 'it is for thy good that she hath devised this unrivalled scheme ' thou hast obtained bhima's daughter and she hath also obtained thee 'and beholding those wonders o bharata king nala the represser of foes cast away all his doubts in respect of damayanti ' and beholding her righteous lord in his own form bhima's daughter of faultless limbs embraced him and king nala also embraced bhima's daughter devoted to him as before and also his children and experienced great delight 'and burying her face in his bosom the beauteous damayanti of large eyes began to sigh heavily remembering her griefs ' 'and overwhelmed with sorrow that tiger among men stood for some time clasping the dust covered damayanti of sweet smiles ' 'and o king the queen mother then with a glad heart told bhima all that had passed between nala and damayanti ' 'and damayanti rejoiced exceedingly in having recovered her lord even as fields of tender plants on receiving a shower ' 'and seeing nala arrived the citizens were in great joy and there arose in the city a loud uproar of delight and rituparna heard that vahuka had already been united with damayanti ' 'and o king it is by good fortune that thou art still alive with thy wife o thou of mighty arms it is evident that damayanti adorned with this wealth of thine that i will win will wait upon me like an apsara in heaven upon indra ' it is by good fortune also that damayanti's ill luck hath at last come to an end 'i shall not therefore impute to thee the faults of

fortune that thou art still alive with thy wife o thou of mighty arms it is evident that damayanti adorned with this wealth of thine that i will win will wait upon me like an apsara in heaven upon

of rama far away she mourned for lakshman as she lay in grief and terror and dismay half fainting on the ground ' how may i know for truth that thou whose form i see before me now art verily the king

the grove or has she sought the pool or rill her pitcher from the wave to fill ' 'say hast thou seen o gentle deer the fawn eyed sita wandering here ' 'where is my darling of the lovely mien whose

in wild lament from grove to grove the mourner went here for a moment sank to rest then started up and onward pressed thus roaming on like one distraught still for his vanished love he sought he searched in wood and hill and glade by rock and brook and wild cascade ' 'deep in the grove she wanders still or walks by blossom covered rill or fish loved river stealing through tall clusters of the dark bamboo or else the dame with arch design to prove thy mood o prince and mine far in some sheltering thicket lies to frighten ere she meet our eyes ' 'o sita o my love ' 'thou fairer than their
