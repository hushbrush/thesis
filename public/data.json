[{"character":"Lady Fujitsubo","bio":"(Her Highness\/ Majesty Fujitsubo) \u2013 Daughter of a previous emperor and thus imperial princess, Fujitsubo enters the service of Emperor Kiritsubo at the age of sixteen, mainly because of her resemblance to the deceased Lady Kiritsubo. She soon becomes an imperial favorite, but also Genji's childhood crush and later lifelong obsession. By chapter seven, \u201cMomiji no ha,\u201d it becomes obvious that Fujitsubo and Genji are already involved in an illicit love affair (although the author does not describe, but rather implies the beginning of the relationship), the result of which is the birth of Reizei (future emperor) whom everyone, except the two lovers, believes to be the son of the Kiritsubo Emperor. Elevated to the rank of Empress and having her son named Heir Apparent (Reizei is supposed to succeed Suzaku), Fujitsubo gradually grows more and more troubled by guilt and the fear of having her secret exposed. Once Genji's advances intensify and, in the public realm, the faction of the Kokiden Lady comes to power, Fujitsubo's only countermeasure is to take vows and become a nun (\u201cSakaki\u201d). By this, she hopes on the one hand, to permanently put Genji off and eliminate the risk of their affair being discovered and, on the other hand, to reassure Kokiden that she renounces any secular, political claims to power. After Genji's return from exile, she forms a political alliance with him and turns into a genuine \u201cpolitically ambitious\u201d [ 2 ] :\u200a30 figure in the tale.

She attracts Genji's attention, but resists his courtship despite his repeated attempts to win her over. Although she will not become a central character in the tale, Utsusemi is memorable as the first woman Genji courts in the tale and whose courtship the readers actually witness and also, arguably, as the first to resist him (chapters 2,3,4; reenters the tale in chapter 16; is mentioned again in chapter 23). A lady of lower rank, after the death of her father she has no choice but to become the second wife of the Iyo Deputy, whose first wife is dead at the time of the narrative (Chapter 2 \u201cHahakigi\u201d). She accidentally attracts Genji's attention during one of his visits to the Governor of Kii's mansion. Forced to avoid a directional taboo, young Genji leaves his father-in-law's mansion at Sanj\u014d and takes refuge to his retainer's house. Ritual purification also forced the women of the Iyo Deputy's household, Utsusemi included, to temporarily reside in the same place. Having heard some feminine voices and the movements in an adjacent room, Genji becomes interested in the Governor's step-mother, whom he already knew was young and potentially attractive. That very same night, Genji steals into the women's quarters and under the guise of being a lady-in-waiting (Utsusemi is calling for Ch\u016bj\u014d, which is both the sobriquet of her servant and Genji's current rank of captain), he slips next to Utsusemi. Once the lady realizes who he really is, she is terrified and would like to call for help, were it not for her awareness that such a discovery would only bring her shame. Even so, she still rejects his advances and keeps strong despite his seductive words, until Genji, at a loss, can only think of taking her away to a more private location. As he carries her out of the room, he encounters the real Ch\u016bj\u014d who is more than ready to defend her mistress against this unknown intruder until she too realizes who he is. Genji's rank and status is simply too high for the two women to dare raise a commotion. Once Genji secures Utsusemi's location, he continues to pour out sweet words and promises, yet the lady \u201cwas as (...) the young bamboo: she bent but was not to be broken.\u201d [ 6 ] Despite the textual description, many Genji critics read the incident as Genji's success despite the lady's resistance. Their interpretation lies heavily on one verb in the original, miru , which, although has multiple meanings, also refers to \u201cmaking love, carnally knowing someone.\u201d Because of this one meaning among many, the traditional interpretation of the scene was that Genji does manage to break through Utsusemi's defenses and ends up sleeping with her. Other critics however, most prominently Margaret Childs, [ 7 ] prefer to reject this interpretation as unfounded. After the incident in question, Genji tries to see the lady two more times. The first time, she finds out about his arrival and takes refuge into another wing of the house, where she surrounds herself with her ladies-in-waiting. Frustrated, Genji ends up taking her younger brother to bed, as her replacement. This episode is considered the sole explicit example of homosexual relations in the tale. The second time, Genji manages to get close to her and he even gets to spy on her playing go with her step-daughter, Nokiba no ogi . This kaimami (man spying on one or multiple women through a gap in the fence\/ curtain\/ screen) became a favorite screen among Genji artists and has been often illustrated as representation for chapter 3 \u201cUtsusemi.\u201d After having spied on her, Genji, with the complicity of Utsusemi's younger brother, Kogimi, steals into her chamber again. Aware of his presence, Utsusemi manages to escape from Genji's embrace by discarding her outer robe like a cicada discards its shell (hence the chapter title). In her desire to escape him, the lady also abandons behind her sleeping step-daughter, who becomes Genji's unwitting prey. Unwilling to admit defeat, or rather to sleep alone for the night, Genji makes do with what is left behind and ends sleeping with Nokiba no ogi, who does not even imagine she has been the victim of mistaken identity. At the end of the fourth chapter, \"Yugao\", Utsusemi leaves the capital with her husband who has been appointed governor of a province. Nokiba no ogi also gets married and leaves the narrative. Utsusemi returns in chapter sixteen, \u201cSekiya,\u201d when she meets Genji on her return from the provinces. They exchange poems, and Utsusemi is shown to regret not being able to accept Genji's advances (because of Utsusemi's marriage and differences in rank). Last time the readers encounter Utsusemi is in chapter twenty-three, \u201cHatsune,\u201d where they learn that she has become a nun after her husband's death. The reason behind her decision is her desire to escape the unwelcome amorous attentions of her step-son, the Governor of Kii. After taking the tonsure, Utsusemi comes to depend upon Genji and takes residence in his former home (his home before the building of the Rokuj\u014d-in), Nij\u014d-in.","normalized_title":"tale of genji","title":"The Tale of Genji","author":"Murasaki Shikibu","subjects":"Aristocracy (Social class) -- Japan -- Fiction; Japan -- Court and courtiers -- Fiction; Japan -- Social life and customs -- To 1600 -- Fiction; Japanese fiction -- To 1600 -- Translations into English; Man-woman relationships -- Fiction; Princes -- Japan -- Fiction","bookshelves":"Browsing: Culture\/Civilization\/Society; Browsing: Fiction; Browsing: Literature","translator":"Arthur Waley","translation_date":2021.0,"original_date":1008,"date_range_confidence":10,"archetype":4,"strength":0.0227783695,"size":5.7371039073,"region":"Japan","lat":36.2048,"lon":138.2529,"saidvsabout":0.3546099291,"quotes":["During this time (I did not hear of it till afterwards) someone who had discovered our friendship began to send her veiled messages which cruelly frightened and distressed her.","Knowing nothing of the trouble she was in, although I often thought of her I neither came nor wrote to her for a long while.","But if I should touch this fine gentleman ...\u2019","'This must all be a dream\u2014that you, so great a Prince, should stoop to consider so humble a creature as I, and I am overwhelmed by so much kindness.

Introduced in the tale narrative in chapter four, \u201cY\u016bgao,\u201d as Genji's lover, Rokuj\u014d is not mentioned in any of the previous chapters. Nevertheless, the later narrative does clarify certain biographical aspects related to this lady. Thus, she is the widow of a former Crown Prince (presumably one of Emperor Kiritsubo's brothers) and would have become an empress, if not for her husband's untimely death. Because of her outstanding social position, she is entitled to be treated with the utmost respect, a fact which Genji, too caught up in his philandering, neglects to do. Humiliated by Genji's disrespect for her, angered and jealous by the rumors of his affairs, Rokuj\u014d becomes the perfect candidate for being the possessing spirit behind Y\u016bgao's demise, at least in traditional interpretations of the tale. Her identification as possessing spirit is further reinforced in the \u201cAoi\u201d chapter, where several clues seem to make her the culprit in Aoi's possession and death. Troubled by the gossip about her involvement in Aoi's possession, Rokuj\u014d herself comes to believe in her own guilt. As a result, she decides to follow her daughter, appointed as Priestess, to Ise. After her return to the capital, she entrusts her daughter, Akikonomu, to Genji and dies in chapter fourteen, \u201cMiotsukushi.\u201d Following her death, she keeps being identified as the spirit inflicting torment upon Genji's women, Murasaki and the Third Princess to be exact.

She makes her debut into the tale as a substitute for her unattainable aunt, but she gradually outshines Fujitsubo in Genji's and the readers\u2019 eyes, turning into \u201ca substitute for all seasons.\u201d [ 2 ] :\u200a160 In fact, her very name, \u201cMurasaki\u201d translated as \u201cLavender,\u201d plays on the similarity of two colors (the color \u201cmurasaki\u201d is purple of a darker hue than \u201cfuji\u201d, wisteria, of Fujitsubo's name). Discovered by Genji in the Northern Hills when she is only ten, she is taken into his Nij\u014d residence after the death of her grandmother (the episode of her kidnapping has definite violent undertones) where she is molded into Genji's ideal woman, not unlike the myth of Galatea, with whom she is often compared. [ 8 ] She remains Genji's most important lover throughout the tale, but, because of her imperfect social status (she is of royal blood on her father's side, but her mother was a commoner), she can never be acknowledged as Genji's main wife (kita no kata). For that reason, her position is perpetually insecure, especially when Genji's attention shifts to other women including Akashi, Asagao, but most importantly, the Third Princess. Childless her entire life, Murasaki can only adopt Genji's daughter by the Akashi Lady and raise her to become an empress. Towards the end of her life, she repeatedly expresses her desire to become a nun, but meets Genji's resolute opposition. She becomes the victim of spirit possession in chapter 35 (the aggressor is once more identified as Rokuj\u014d, though this interpretation has been debated [ 5 ] ) and dies in chapter 40 without having realized her wish. Murasaki as a character of the Genji has triggered much debate among scholars. Some see her as an utterly miserable character, [ 8 ] while others claim that her relationship with Genji is the best things that could have happened to a woman of Murasaki's status.
