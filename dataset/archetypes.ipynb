The giant Polyphemus and his cave described; the usage Ulysses and his companions met with there; and, lastly, the method and artifice by which he escaped. Then thus Ulysses: “Thou whom first in sway, As first in virtue, these thy realms obey; How sweet the products of a peaceful reign! The heaven-taught poet and enchanting strain; The well-filled palace, the perpetual feast, A land rejoicing, and a people bless’d! How goodly seems it ever to employ Man’s social days in union and in joy; The plenteous hoard high-heap’d with cates divine, And o’er the foaming bowl the laughing wine! “Amid these joys, why seeks thy mind to know The unhappy series of a wanderer’s woe? Rememberance sad, whose image to review, Alas, I must open all my wounds anew! And oh, what first, what last shall I relate, Of woes unnumbered sent by Heaven and Fate? “Know first the man (though now a wretch distress’d) Who hopes thee, monarch, for his future guest. Behold Ulysses! no ignoble name, Earth sounds my wisdom and high heaven my fame. “My native soil is Ithaca the fair, Where high Neritus waves his woods in air; Dulichium, Same and Zaccynthus crown’d With shady mountains spread their isles around. (These to the north and night’s dark regions run, Those to Aurora and the rising sun). Low lies our isle, yet bless’d in fruitful stores; Strong are her sons, though rocky are her shores; And none, ah none no lovely to my sight, Of all the lands that heaven o’erspreads with light. In vain Calypso long constrained my stay, With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay; With all her charms as vainly Circe strove, And added magic to secure my love. In pomps or joys, the palace or the grot, My country’s image never was forgot; My absent parents rose before my sight, And distant lay contentment and delight. “Hear, then, the woes which mighty Jove ordain’d To wait my passage from the Trojan land. The winds from Ilion to the Cicons’ shore, Beneath cold Ismarus our vessels bore. We boldly landed on the hostile place, And sack’d the city, and destroy’d the race, Their wives made captive, their possessions shared, And every soldier found a like reward I then advised to'),\n",

These in my hollow ship the monarch hung, Securely fetter’d by a silver thong: But Zephyrus exempt, with friendly gales He charged to fill, and guide the swelling sails: Rare gift! but O, what gift to fools avails! “Nine prosperous days we plied the labouring oar; The tenth presents our daughter of Antiphates the king; She to Artacia’s silver streams came down; (Artacia’s streams alone supply the town); The damsel they approach, and ask’d what race The people were? who monarch of the place?

Swift at her call her husband scour’d away To wreak his hunger on the destined prey; One for his food the raging glutton slew, But two rush’d out, and to the navy flew. “Balk’d of his prey, the yelling monster flies, And fills the city with his hideous cries; A ghastly band of giants hear the roar, And, pouring down the mountains, crowd the shore. Fragments they rend from off the craggy brow And dash the ruins on the ships below; The crackling vessels burst; hoarse groans arise, And mingled horrors echo to the skies; The men like fish, they struck upon the flood, And cramm’d their filthy throats with human food.

The sailors catch the word, their oars they seize, And sweep with equal strokes the smoky seas; Clear of the rocks the impatient vessel flies; Whilst in the port each wretch encumber’d dies.

Say, shall we seek access?’ With that they call; And wide unfold the portals of the hall. “The goddess, rising, asks her guests to stay, Who blindly follow where she leads the way. Eurylochus alone of all the band, Suspecting fraud, more prudently remain’d. On thrones around with downy coverings graced, With semblance fair, the unhappy men she placed. Milk newly press’d, the sacred flour of wheat, And honey fresh, and Pramnian wines the treat: But venom’d was the bread, and mix’d the bowl, With drugs of force to darken all the soul: Soon in the luscious feast themselves they lost, And drank oblivion of their native coast. Instant her circling wand the goddess waves, To hogs transforms them, and the sty receives. No more was seen the human form divine; Head, face, and members, bristle into swine: Still cursed with sense, their minds remain alone, And their own voice affrights them when they groan. Meanwhile the goddess in disdain bestows The mast and acorn, brutal food! and strows The fruits and cornel, as their feast, around; Now prone and grovelling on unsavoury ground. “Eurylochus, with pensive steps and slow. Aghast returns; the messenger of woe, And bitter fate. To speak he made essay, In vain essay’d, nor would his tongue obey. His swelling heart denied the words their way: But speaking tears the want of words supply, And the full soul bursts copious from his eye. Affrighted, anxious for our fellows’ fates, We press to hear what sadly he relates: “We went, Ulysses! (such was thy command) Through the lone thicket and the desert land. A palace in a woody vale we found Brown with dark forests, and with shades around. A voice celestial echoed through the dome, Or nymph or goddess, chanting to the loom. Access we sought, nor was access denied: Radiant she came: the portals open’d wide: The goddess mild invites the guests to stay: They blindly follow where she leads the way. I only wait behind of all the train: I waited long, and eyed the doors in vain: The rest are vanish’d, none repass’d the gate, And not a man appears to tell their fate.’ “I heard, and instant o’er my shoulder flung The belt in which my weighty falchion hung (A beamy blade): then seized the bended'),\n",

There seek the Theban bard, deprived of sight; Within, irradiate with prophetic light; To whom Persephone, entire and whole, Gave to retain the unseparated soul: The rest are forms, of empty ether made; Impassive semblance, and a flitting shade.’ “Struck at the word, my very heart was dead: Pensive I sate: my tears bedew’d the bed: To hate the light and life my soul begun, And saw that all was grief beneath the sun: Composed at length the gushing tears suppress’d, And my toss’d limbs now wearied into rest. ‘How shall I tread (I cried), ah, Circe! say, The dark descent, and who shall guide the way? Can living eyes behold the realms below? What bark to waft me, and what wind to blow?’ “‘Thy fated road (the magic power replied), Divine Ulysses! ask no mortal guide. Rear but the mast, the spacious sail display, The northern winds shall wing thee on thy way. Soon shalt thou reach old Ocean’s utmost ends, Where to the main the shelving shore descends; The barren trees of Proserpine’s black woods, Poplars and willows trembling o’er the floods: There fix thy vessel in the lonely bay, And enter there the kingdoms void of day, Where Phlegethon’s loud torrents, rushing down, Hiss in the flaming gulf of Acheron; And where, slow rolling from the Stygian bed, Cocytus’ lamentable waters spread: Where the dark rock o’erhangs the infernal lake, And mingling streams eternal murmurs make. First draw thy falchion, and on every side Trench the black earth a cubit long and wide: To all the shades around libations pour, And o’er the ingredients strew the hallow’d flour: New wine and milk, with honey temper’d bring, And living water from the crystal spring.

No bird of air, no dove of swiftest wing, That bears ambrosia the depth below. Wide to the west the horrid gulf extends, And the dire passage down to hell descends.

Hideous her voice, and with less terrors roar The whelps of lions in the midnight hour. Twelve feet, deform’d and foul, the fiend dispreads; Six horrid necks she rears, and six terrific heads; Her jaws grin dreadful with three rows of teeth; Jaggy they stand, the gaping den of death; Her parts obscene the raging billows hide; Her bosom terribly o’erlooks the tide. When stung with hunger she embroils the flood, The sea-dog and the dolphin are her food; She makes the huge leviathan her prey, And all the monsters of the watery way; The swiftest racer of the azure plain Here fills her sails, and spreads her oars in vain; Fell Scylla rises, in her fury roars, At once six mouths expands, at once six men devours. “‘Close by, a rock of less enormous height Breaks the wild waves, and forms a dangerous strait; Full on its crown a fig’s green branches rise, And shoot a leafy forest to the skies; Beneath, Charybdis holds her boisterous reign ’Midst roaring whirlpools, and absorbs the main; Thrice in her gulfs the boiling seas subside, Thrice in dire thunders she refunds the tide.

Ah, shun the horrid gulf! by Scylla fly. ’Tis better six to lose, than all to die.’ “I then: ‘O nymph propitious to my prayer, Goddess divine, my guardian power, declare, Is the foul fiend from human vengeance freed?

She mocks the weak attempts of human might; Oh, fly her rage! thy conquest is thy flight. If but to seize thy arms thou make delay, Again thy fury vindicates her prey; Her six mouths yawn, and six are snatch’d away. From her foul wound Crataeis gave to air This dreadful pest!

How dash’d like dogs, his friends the Cyclops tore (Not unrevenged), and quaff’d the spouting gore; How the loud storms in prison bound, he sails From friendly Aeolus with prosperous gales: Yet fate withstands! a sudden tempest roars, And whirls him groaning from his native shores: How on the barbarous Laestrigonian coast, By savage hands his fleet and friends lie lost; How scarce himself survived: he paints the bower, The spells of Circe, and her magic power; His dreadful journey to the realms beneath, To seek Tiresias in the vales of death; How in the doleful mansions lie')]"
