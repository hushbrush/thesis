    "bio":"(Her Highness\/ Majesty Fujitsubo) \u2013 Daughter of a previous emperor and thus imperial princess, Fujitsubo enters the service of Emperor Kiritsubo at the age of sixteen, mainly because of her resemblance to the deceased Lady Kiritsubo. She soon becomes an imperial favorite, but also Genji's childhood crush and later lifelong obsession. By chapter seven, \u201cMomiji no ha,\u201d it becomes obvious that Fujitsubo and Genji are already involved in an illicit love affair (although the author does not describe, but rather implies the beginning of the relationship), the result of which is the birth of Reizei (future emperor) whom everyone, except the two lovers, believes to be the son of the Kiritsubo Emperor. Elevated to the rank of Empress and having her son named Heir Apparent (Reizei is supposed to succeed Suzaku), Fujitsubo gradually grows more and more troubled by guilt and the fear of having her secret exposed. Once Genji's advances intensify and, in the public realm, the faction of the Kokiden Lady comes to power, Fujitsubo's only countermeasure is to take vows and become a nun (\u201cSakaki\u201d). By this, she hopes on the one hand, to permanently put Genji off and eliminate the risk of their affair being discovered and, on the other hand, to reassure Kokiden that she renounces any secular, political claims to power. After Genji's return from exile, she forms a political alliance with him and turns into a genuine \u201cpolitically ambitious\u201d [ 2 ] : 30 figure in the tale. Only on her deathbed (in \u201cUsugumo\u201d) does she return to being a romantic heroine. [ 2 ] : 44 Nevertheless, Fujitsubo's importance in the tale lies beyond her immediate contribution to the plot, in what Norma Field termed as being an \u201coriginal substitute\u201d [ 2 ] : 24 (she makes her debut as a substitute for Kiritsubo, yet, later, Genji will look for substitutes for her, in women such as Utsusemi, the Third Princess, but most of all, in Murasaki). (chapter 1; chapter 10 becomes a nun; chapter 19 dies)",

    "bio":"(\u7a7a\u8749\/Cicada Shell\/ Lady of the Locust Shell) \u2013 She is the wife of the Iyo Deputy and stepmother of the Governor of Kii. She attracts Genji's attention, but resists his courtship despite his repeated attempts to win her over. Although she will not become a central character in the tale, Utsusemi is memorable as the first woman Genji courts in the tale and whose courtship the readers actually witness and also, arguably, as the first to resist him (chapters 2,3,4; reenters the tale in chapter 16; is mentioned again in chapter 23). A lady of lower rank, after the death of her father she has no choice but to become the second wife of the Iyo Deputy, whose first wife is dead at the time of the narrative (Chapter 2 \u201cHahakigi\u201d). She accidentally attracts Genji's attention during one of his visits to the Governor of Kii's mansion. Forced to avoid a directional taboo, young Genji leaves his father-in-law's mansion at Sanj\u014d and takes refuge to his retainer's house. Ritual purification also forced the women of the Iyo Deputy's household, Utsusemi included, to temporarily reside in the same place. Having heard some feminine voices and the movements in an adjacent room, Genji becomes interested in the Governor's step-mother, whom he already knew was young and potentially attractive. That very same night, Genji steals into the women's quarters and under the guise of being a lady-in-waiting (Utsusemi is calling for Ch\u016bj\u014d, which is both the sobriquet of her servant and Genji's current rank of captain), he slips next to Utsusemi. Once the lady realizes who he really is, she is terrified and would like to call for help, were it not for her awareness that such a discovery would only bring her shame. Even so, she still rejects his advances and keeps strong despite his seductive words, until Genji, at a loss, can only think of taking her away to a more private location. As he carries her out of the room, he encounters the real Ch\u016bj\u014d who is more than ready to defend her mistress against this unknown intruder until she too realizes who he is. Genji's rank and status is simply too high for the two women to dare raise a commotion. Once Genji secures Utsusemi's location, he continues to pour out sweet words and promises, yet the lady \u201cwas as (...) the young bamboo: she bent but was not to be broken.\u201d [ 6 ] Despite the textual description, many Genji critics read the incident as Genji's success despite the lady's resistance. Their interpretation lies heavily on one verb in the original, miru , which, although has multiple meanings, also refers to \u201cmaking love, carnally knowing someone.\u201d Because of this one meaning among many, the traditional interpretation of the scene was that Genji does manage to break through Utsusemi's defenses and ends up sleeping with her. Other critics however, most prominently Margaret Childs, [ 7 ] prefer to reject this interpretation as unfounded. After the incident in question, Genji tries to see the lady two more times. The first time, she finds out about his arrival and takes refuge into another wing of the house, where she surrounds herself with her ladies-in-waiting. Frustrated, Genji ends up taking her younger brother to bed, as her replacement. This episode is considered the sole explicit example of homosexual relations in the tale. The second time, Genji manages to get close to her and he even gets to spy on her playing go with her step-daughter, Nokiba no ogi . This kaimami (man spying on one or multiple women through a gap in the fence\/ curtain\/ screen) became a favorite screen among Genji artists and has been often illustrated as representation for chapter 3 \u201cUtsusemi.\u201d After having spied on her, Genji, with the complicity of Utsusemi's younger brother, Kogimi, steals into her chamber again. Aware of his presence, Utsusemi manages to escape from Genji's embrace by discarding her outer robe like a cicada discards its shell (hence the chapter title). In her desire to escape him, the lady also abandons behind her sleeping step-daughter, who becomes Genji's unwitting prey. Unwilling to admit defeat, or rather to sleep alone for the night, Genji makes do with what is left behind and ends sleeping with Nokiba no ogi, who does not even imagine she has been the victim of mistaken identity. At the end of the fourth chapter, \"Yugao\", Utsusemi leaves the capital with her husband who has been appointed governor of a province. Nokiba no ogi also gets married and leaves the narrative. Utsusemi returns in chapter sixteen, \u201cSekiya,\u201d when she meets Genji on her return from the provinces. They exchange poems, and Utsusemi is shown to regret not being able to accept Genji's advances (because of Utsusemi's marriage and differences in rank). Last time the readers encounter Utsusemi is in chapter twenty-three, \u201cHatsune,\u201d where they learn that she has become a nun after her husband's death. The reason behind her decision is her desire to escape the unwelcome amorous attentions of her step-son, the Governor of Kii. After taking the tonsure, Utsusemi comes to depend upon Genji and takes residence in his former home (his home before the building of the Rokuj\u014d-in), Nij\u014d-in.",

be living a comfortless and unprotected life ' 'i was taking lessons from her father who was a professor ' 'it is i fear as sorrowful a tale as that which uma no kami has told you ' 'i indeed am fast forgetting her but she it may be cannot put me out of her mind and i fear there may be nights when thoughts that she would gladly banish burn fiercely in her breast ' 'when all is said and done' said uma no kami 'my friend though i pine for her now that she is gone was a sad plague to me while i had her and we must own that such a one will in the end be sure to make us wish ourselves well rid of her ' 'the world appears to be so constructed that we shall in the end be always at a loss to make a reasoned' ' you will come back to fetch your mistress in the morning ' 'but if i should touch this fine gentleman ' 'this must all be a dream that you so great a prince should stoop to consider so humble a creature as i and i am overwhelmed by so much kindness 'a zuryo s wife there is no altering that and you ' i am afraid i know very little about these questions of rank and precedence such things are too confusing to carry in one's head 'why do you treat me so unkindly it is true that the manner of our meeting was strange yet i think that fate meant us to meet it is harsh that you should shrink from me as though the world and you had never met ' how can i send news to you for madam ' he said raising his voice that the maid chujo might hear 'such love as mine and such pitiless cruelty as yours have never been seen in the world before ' 'among them was one perhaps whose heart beat wildly as she looked ' 'how tiresome he must think her ' 'yet she had as we have seen for some reason got it into her head that at a leisurely meeting she would not please him as she had done at that first fleeting and dreamlike encounter ' 'it is more than i can bear i am sick of myself and of the world and do not want to go on living any more' 'it is no use' thought genji 'saying that i have come to the wrong room for i have no business anywhere here nor is it worth while pursuing my real lady for she would not have vanished like this if she cared a straw about me ' i am going to sleep in the ante room' the boy said out loud 'i shall leave the door open so as to make a draught ' 'not knowing what was to happen next and much doubting whether any good would come of the venture with great trepidation he followed the boy to the curtain that screened the main bedroom and pulling it aside entered on tip toe ' 'filled with a sudden terror and utter bewilderment she sprang from the bed threw a fragile gauze mantle over her shoulders and fled silently from the room ' it is no use' thought genji 'saying that i have come to the wrong room for i have no business anywhere here nor is it worth while pursuing my real lady for she would not have vanished like this if she cared a straw about me ' 'really she was the most obstinate creature in the world ' 'is not this kind of thing much more amusing than what happens with people whom one knows ' 'do not think unkindly of me our meeting must for the present remain a secret ' 'i am in a position which does not always allow me to act as i please ' 'your people too would no doubt interfere if they should hear of it which would be very tiresome ' 'wait patiently and do not forget me ' 'of course we must not let ordinary people into our secret' he answered 'but there is no reason why this little page should not sometimes carry a message ' 'i am afraid it will not be very easy for me even to write to you people would think it very odd ' 'really she was the most obstinate creature in the world ' 'is not this kind of thing much more amusing than what happens with people whom one knows ' 'do not think unkindly of me our meeting must for the present remain a secret ' 'i am afraid it will not be very easy for me even to write to you people would think it very odd ' 'of course we must not let ordinary people into our secret' he answered 'but there is no reason why this little page should not sometimes carry a message ' 'and you will soon be as big as she is little master ' 'you have been on duty haven t you dear ' 'why should he speak of it _the coat that the fishers of iseo left lying upon the shore _' 'what of this discarded mantle why should he speak of it ' her sleeve so often wet with tears was like the cicada's dew drenched wing 'he was very sorry about her but he was afraid that if he wrote to her utsusemi might find out and that would prejudice his chances ' 'these scruples are absurd' 'my daughter is to be married' 'my daughter is to be married' 'my lady' 'next time i come to visit your mother' said genji 'you must let me have a chance of peeping at them ' ' who the mistress is he said i have not been able to discover and for the most part she is at great pains not to show herself ' 'one day seeing a carriage with outriders coming towards the house one of the maids rushed off calling out ukon ukon come quickly and look the captain s carriage is coming this way ' 'i am going to take you somewhere very nice where no one will disturb us' 'one or the other of us must be a fox in disguise' 'no no' 'your ways are so strange i should be frightened to go with' ' eh how cold it is i can t believe we shall do much with the crops this year i don t know what s going to happen about my carrying trade said another things look very bad ' 'my foster mother has been very ill since the fifth month ' 'his majesty has been uneasy since yesterday when his envoys sought everywhere for your highness in vain ' 'she sent word that she desired to see me once more before she died and as i was very fond of her when i was a child i could not refuse ' 'moreover since early morning i have had a cough and very bad headache so you will forgive me for treating you in this way ' 'i will give the emperor your message but i must tell you that last night when you were out he sent messengers to look for you and seemed if i may venture to say so to be in a very ill humour ' 'what really happened to you last night what you told me just now cannot possibly be true ' 'you need not go into details simply tell him that unintentionally i became exposed to a pollution and apologize to him for me as best you can ' 'there can be no harm in my telling you that' 'and i should have done so before did i not somehow feel it a shame to be prating to you now about things she would not have me speak of while she was alive ' 'but there was never anyone in the world like my lady for keeping things to herself she could never bear that other people should know what was on her mind ' 'yes indeed ' she answered 'it was born in part i had no mind to put a distance between us but i had no experience in such affairs as this ' 'when on each seventh day i cause the names of the buddhas to be written for her comfort and salvation whom am i to name in my inward prayer ' 'there can be no harm in my telling you that' said ukon 'and i should have done so before did i not somehow feel it a shame to be prating to you now about things she would not have me speak of while she was alive ' 'could you get hold of it and bring it to me here without letting anyone know where you were taking it it would be a great comfort to me in my present misery to have some remembrance of her near me ' 'i am very glad that this has entered your head' ' though she never told me so i think sir it troubled her sorely that you should have come upon her when she was living in so wretched a place ' 'where is it now ' asked genji 'could you get hold of it and bring it to me here without letting anyone know where you were taking it it would be a great comfort to me in my present misery to have some remembrance of her near me ' 'i ought of course to tell chujo but that would lead to useless and painful discussions about what has happened somehow or other i will manage to bring her up here in my palace i think there can be no harm in that and you will easily enough find some story to tell to whatever people are now looking after her ' 'i did not ask for news and you did not ask why i was silent so the days wore on and i remained in sorrow and dismay ' 'i did not ask for news and you did not ask why i was silent so the days wore on and i remained in sorrow and dismay ' 'the faint wind of your favour that but for a moment blew with grief has part befrosted the small sedge of the eaves ' 'the faint wind of your favour that but for a moment blew with grief has part befrosted the small sedge of the eaves ' 'i did not ask for news and you did not ask why i was silent so the days wore on and i remained in sorrow and dismay ' of this life fragile as the utsusemi's shell already i was weary when your word came and gave me strength to live anew ' this is indeed an unexpected attention on your part ' 'though wheresoever it shines men marvel at its light who has before thought fit to follow the full moon to the hill whereon it sets ' 'it is most unsafe for you to go about like this ' said chujo 'i really mean it you ought always to have a bodyguard then you are all right whatever happens i wish you would always let me come with you ' 'though wheresoever it shines men marvel at its light who has before thought fit to follow the full moon to the hill whereon it sets ' 'though each of them had an appointment elsewhere they agreed not to part ' 'they did not send for torch bearers to see them in at the gates but creeping in very quietly stole to a portico where they could not be seen and had their ordinary clothes brought to them there ' 'she was thinking in her despair that perhaps it would be better if she went and lived in some place where she would never see genji at all ' 'what could be the reason ' 'so he too has been trying his hand ' thought genji smiling to himself 'what could be the reason ' 'so he too has been trying his hand ' thought genji smiling to himself 'i cannot understand why the princess should refuse to take any notice of my letters it is really very uncivil of her ' 'as you know my affections never alter and if i have ever seemed to the world to be unfaithful it has always been because in reality my suit had met with some unexpected discouragement ' 'what could be the reason ' 'thinking that such images were suitable to a lady brought up in these rustic surroundings in most of the poems which they sent her they alluded to delicate trees and flowers or other aspects of nature hoping sooner or later to hit on some topic which would arouse her interest in their suit ' 'i wonder whether you have had any answer i must confess that as an experiment i too sent a mild hint but without any success so i have not repeated it ' 'i wonder whether you have had any answer ' 'as you know my affections never alter and if i have ever seemed to the world to be unfaithful it has always been because in reality my suit had met with some unexpected discouragement ' 'come ' answered myobu 'it will never do for 'for some reason i imagine her as very gentle and forgiving ' 'what a disillusionment and the worst of it was that she was a princess a great lady ' 'all at once he remembered the chilly appearance which that unhappy bloom had given to the princess s face and he could not help smiling ' 'but since he had actually seen her in all her tragic uncouthness pity gained the upper hand and henceforward he kept in constant touch with her and showed her every kindness ' 'it was hard to believe that the princess belonged to a class so far above that of utsusemi ' 'utsusemi too he remembered had seemed to him far from handsome when he had peeped at her on the evening of her sudden flight ' 'but she at least knew how to behave and that saved her plainness from being obtrusive ' 'for in idle moments he still regretted the loss of utsusemi and it rankled in him yet that he had in the end allowed her unyielding persistency to win the day ' ' but this said genji taking it is the last thing in the world that you could have any reason to hide from me ' 'must we who once would not allow even the thickness of a garment to part us be now far from each other for whole nights on end ' ' this is too bad he whispered i am going home what possessed you to let me in on a night when you knew that someone else was coming ' 'are you in your right mind ' 'many secrets should have thought it necessary to spy upon him in this fashion ' 'gentlemen gentlemen ' flung herself between them in an attitude of romantic supplication 'are you in your right mind ' 'should you now get it in exchange for yours this tattered cloak will but reveal the secrets it is meant to hide ' 'at the antics of the prancing wave you have good cause to be angry but blameless indeed is the shore on whose sands it lashed ' 'to which genji replied with an acrostic poem' 'at the antics of the prancing wave you have good cause to be angry ' 'had you not better have this sewn on before you wear your cloak ' 'at the antics of the prancing wave you have good cause to be angry but blameless indeed is the shore on whose sands it lashed' 'no indeed ' said genji 'but i feel i owe you an apology for preventing you from spending a happy hour with the lady whom you had come to visit 'it is because he is fond of me there can be no other reason ' she decided at last 'were i but a common' 'why had not genji visited her again he must surely know whose daughter she was but how should he know which daughter ' 'tell me whether her soul be in the rain or whether in the clouds above ' 'it is too bad to make fun of her in this way please do not do it ' 'to you it will seem a poor thing in contrast to the flowers that are gone ' 'new tears but tears of joy it brings this blossom from a meadow that is now laid waste ' 'though to rain her soul be turned yet where in the clouded vault of heaven is that one mist wreath which is she ' 'since she whom once we knew beyond the country of the clouds is fled two months of storm and darkness now'",

Her name literally means \u201cthe captain.\u201d Genji was a Captain in the Palace Guards at the time of his meeting with Utsusemi, so he is able to steal into the lady's chambers by taking advantage of the confusion between Ch\u016bj\u014d's name and his rank. (Utsusemi calls for Ch\u016bj\u014d and Genji pretends he misinterpreted her words). Because there are six other ladies-in-waiting in the tale all referred to as \u201cCh\u016bj\u014d\u201d, the best way to differentiate among them is by the identities of their mistresses or masters.(chapter 2)",

reason that i did not receive one ' 'chujo would become insufferably cock a hoop if he got into his head the idea that the princess had transferred her affections from genji to himself ' you still seem very sleepy ' said chujo in an aggrieved tone 'i am sure you have been doing something interesting that you do not want to tell me about ' 'to no chujo was his partner but though both in skill and beauty he far surpassed the common run of performers the last ' 'there seemed no better way of discovering whether it was conceivably possible to regard the lady in such a light than to make love to her himself ' 'chujo stole on tip toe into the room ' 'this is too bad ' he whispered 'i am going home what possessed you to let me in on a night when you knew that someone else was coming ' 'this is too bad ' he whispered 'i am going home what possessed you to let me in on a night when you knew that someone else was coming ' 'chujo entered the room and going straight up to the screen began in a business like manner to fold it up ' 'wondering how much longer genji would take to recognize him chujo did not say a word but putting on the most ferocious air imaginable drew his sword from the scabbard ' 'are you in your right mind ' said genji at last 'this is really a very poor sort of joke do you mind letting me get into my cloak ' whereupon chujo snatched the as though he had fallen asleep 'chujo did not say a word but putting on the most ferocious air imaginable drew his sword from the scabbard ' very well then ' said genji 'if you are to have my cloak i must have yours ' and so saying he pulled open the clasp of chujo's belt and began tugging his cloak from his shoulders 'chujo resisted and a long tussle followed in which the cloak was torn to shreds ' 'wondering how much longer genji would take to recognize him chujo did not say a word but putting on the most ferocious air imaginable drew his sword from the scabbard ' whereupon the lady crying 'gentlemen gentlemen ' flung herself between them in an attitude of romantic supplication 'should you now get it in exchange for yours this tattered cloak will but reveal the secrets it is meant to hide ' 'wondering how much longer genji would take to recognize him chujo did not say a word but putting on the most ferocious air imaginable drew his sword from the scabbard ' 'are you in your right mind ' 'should you now get it in exchange for yours this tattered cloak will but reveal the secrets it is meant to hide' 'to which genji replied with an acrostic poem in which he complained that chujo with whom he shared so many secrets should have thought it necessary to spy upon him in this fashion ' 'had you not better have this sewn on before you wear your cloak ' 'very well then ' said genji 'if you are to have my cloak i must have yours ' and so saying he pulled open the clasp of chujo's belt and began tugging his cloak from his shoulders 'on the floor she found a belt and a buckle which she sent to genji next day with a complicated acrostic poem in which she compared these stranded properties to the weeds which after their straining and tugging the waves leave upon the shore ' it is meant ' recited to no chujo 'had you not better have this sewn on before you wear your cloak ' 'you have dragged her away from me as in the scuffle you snatched from me this belt ' 'you have dragged her away from me as in the scuffle you snatched from me this belt' 'have i not good reason to be angry with you ' 'had you not better have this sewn on before you wear your cloak ' 'this belt ' said chujo in his answering poem and added 'have i not good reason to be angry with you ' 'you have dragged her away from me as in the scuffle you snatched from me this belt' 'have i not good reason to be angry with you ' 'you have dragged her away from me as in the scuffle you snatched from me this belt' 'have i not good reason to be angry with you ' ' you have dragged her away from me as in the scuffle you snatched from me this belt said chujo in his answering poem and added have i not good reason to be angry with you ' ' no indeed said genji ' 'but to no chujo was ready to dispute with him on any subject and was by no means inclined always to let him have his own way ' 'in an interval chujo came up to genji and asked him in a low voice whether he had decided in future to be a little more communicative about his affairs ' 'no indeed ' said genji 'but i feel i owe you an apology for preventing you from spending a happy hour with the lady whom you had come to visit everything in life seems to go wrong ' so they whispered 'and why have we not seen to no chujo ' said the heir apparent 'and why have we not seen to no chujo ' 'why then had she refused to give him any chance of communicating with her ' 'she allowed herself to listen to genji s youthful addresses and was soon living in constant torment and agitation lest her indiscretion should be discovered ' 'tell me whether her soul be in the rain or whether in the clouds above ' 'though to rain her soul be turned yet where in the clouded vault of heaven is that one mist wreath which is she ' 'tell me whether her soul be in the rain or whether in the clouds above ' 'tell me whether her soul be in the rain or whether in the clouds above ' 'though to rain her soul be turned yet where in the clouded vault of heaven is that one mist wreath which

amuse himself well enough by trifling from time to time with some lady at the court will get what pleasure he can out of it while he is with her and not trouble his head about what goes on when he is

confidence in me ' 'such confidence indeed that when from time to time i was obliged to behave in such a way as might well have aroused her resentment she seemed not to notice that anything was amiss and even when i neglected her for many weeks she treated me as though i were still coming every day ' 'in the end indeed i found this readiness to receive me whenever and however i came very painful and determined for the future to merit her strange confidence ' 'her parents were dead and this was perhaps why since i was all she had in the world she treated me with such loving meekness despite the many wrongs i did her ' 'during this time i did not hear of it till afterwards someone who had discovered our friendship began to send her veiled messages which cruelly frightened and distressed her ' 'knowing nothing of the trouble she was in although i often thought of her i neither came nor wrote to her for a long while ' 'just when she was in her worst despair a child was born and at last in her distress she plucked a blossom of the flower that is called child of my heart and sent it to me ' 'i will tell you a story about myself ' 'her parents were dead and this was perhaps why since i was all she had in the world she treated me with such loving meekness despite the many wrongs i did her ' well' said genji 'and did she write a message to go with it ' 'your diffident lady to no

will be back presently ' 'but if i should touch this fine gentleman ' 'this must all be a dream that you so great a prince should stoop to consider so humble a creature as i and i am overwhelmed by so much kindness 'a zuryo s wife there is no altering that and you 'why do you treat me so unkindly ' 'if this had happened long ago before my troubles before my lot was cast perhaps i should have been glad to take your kindness while it lasted knowing that you would soon think better of your strange condescension ' 'but now that my course is fixed what can such meetings bring me save misery and

not well that my ladies are with me and i am going to be massaged ' 'this is a disgrace a hideous disgrace' 'i knew not the nature of the being too awkward or unfamiliar will give an adequate general idea of what is meant' 'chujo means captain which was genji s rank at the time ' 'my lady' 'next time i come to visit your mother' said genji 'you must let me have a chance of peeping at them ' 'what

have not thought it right to present myself to the emperor my father ' 'you need not go into details ' answered genji impatiently 'simply tell him that unintentionally i became exposed to a pollution

reproaches or even the loss of a little reputation ' 'only nakatsukasa sat drooping listlessly for her passion had become known to aoi s mother and the rest and they were being very unpleasant about

will but trust me she will find that her being alone in the world so far from exposing her to callous treatment makes her the more attractive ' 'come ' answered myobu 'it will never do for you to run away with the idea that you can treat this great lady as a pleasant wayside distraction on the contrary she is extremely difficult of access and her rank has accustomed her to be treated with deference and ceremony ' 'thinking that such images were suitable to a lady brought up in these rustic surroundings in most of the poems which they sent her they alluded to delicate trees and flowers or other aspects of nature hoping sooner or later to hit on some topic which would arouse her interest in their suit ' 'i wonder whether you have had any answer i must confess that as an experiment i too sent a mild hint but without any success so i have not repeated it ' 'i cannot understand why the princess should refuse to take any notice of my letters it is really very uncivil of her ' 'it is a strangely false conception of my character ' 'as you know my affections never alter and if i have ever seemed to the world to be unfaithful it has always been because in reality my suit had met with

it ' 'had her defects been less striking he could not possibly have continued these distressing visits ' 'should you go on liking me if i were always as ugly as this ' 'oh why did you do it ' she cried 'how horrible ' 'that night genji was promoted to the first class of the third rank and to no chujo was promoted to intermediate standing between the first and second classes of the fourth rank ' 'here in the portico of the eastern she was often called upon to play with the professional male musicians in the imperial orchestra ' 'here in the portico of the eastern she was often called upon to play with the professional male musicians in the imperial orchestra ' 'it was intolerable thought to no chujo that genji should be praised as a quiet and serious young man and should constantly rebuke him for his frivolity while all the time he was carrying on a multiplicity of interesting intrigues which out of mere churlishness he kept entirely hidden from all his friends ' 'to scare him a little at such a moment would be an excellent way to punish him for his unfriendliness ' 'part have no mind to haunt the loggias of your eastern house ' 'to scare him a little at such a moment would be an excellent way to punish him for his unfriendliness ' 'but he was enter the gentlewoman s apartment you may be sure he was delighted ' 'chujo however refrained from showing the slightest sign of amusement and continued to look as alarming and ferocious as he could ' are you in your right mind ' said genji at last 'this is really a very poor sort of joke do you mind letting me get into my cloak ' 'she seized him by the back of his coat and with a practised though trembling hand pulled him away from the screen ' 'are you in your right mind ' 'very well then ' said genji 'if you are to

myself so much that had i but been a few years younger i would positively have joined in the dancing ' 'no special steps were taken to discover the musicians ' answered genji 'but if you sir had indeed honoured us a new lustre would have been added to' 'why had not genji visited her again he must surely know whose daughter she was but how should he know which daughter ' 'she waited in great impatience and distress but of genji there was no news ' 'tell me whether her soul be in the rain or whether in the clouds above ' 'poor old lady it is too bad to make fun of her in this way please do not do it ' 'though to rain her soul be turned yet where in the clouded vault of heaven is that one mist wreath which is she ' 'since she whom once we knew beyond the country of the clouds is fled two months of storm and darkness now have seared the wintry earth below ' 'though to rain her soul be turned yet where in the clouded vault of heaven is that one mist wreath which is she ' 'since she whom once we knew beyond the country of the clouds is fled two months of storm and darkness now have seared the wintry earth below ' 'to you it will seem a balustrade of the balcony above the main western door ' 'since she whom once we knew beyond the country of the clouds is fled two months of storm and darkness now have seared the wintry earth below ' 'to you it will seem a poor thing in contrast to the flowers that are gone ' 'new tears but tears of joy it brings this blossom from a meadow that is now laid waste ' 'since she whom once we knew beyond the country of the clouds is fled two months of storm and darkness now' 'when genji had retired to the eastern wing he sent for a certain lady chujo to rub his limbs'",

However, because of the jealousy of T\u014d no Ch\u016bj\u014d's main wife, Y\u016bgao leaves him and goes into hiding. It is under these circumstances that Genji encounters her, while out visiting his former wet nurse (Koremitsu's mother). The woman's name translates as \u201cEvening Faces\u201d and refers to the flowers that attract Genji's attraction to Y\u016bgao's shabby abode. Genji becomes very fond of this woman, of whom he apparently knows next to nothing, and proceeds to move her to an abandoned mansion where she falls prey to spirit possession and dies. The possessing spirit is traditionally associated with Lady Rokuj\u014d. (chapter 4)",

Orphaned at an early age, Ukon was raised by Y\u016bgao's father and grew up together with the lady, whom she is extremely attached to. After losing Y\u016bgao, she wants to follow her mistress into death, but gives in to Genji's pleas and enters his service. She will come to play a great role in the discovery of Y\u016bgao's daughter, Tamakazura. There are two other ladies-in-waiting named Ukon in the tale (one in the service of Naka no Kimi, the other in the service of Ukifune, but only the latter plays a similarly important role as Y\u016bgao's Ukon).(chapters 4 and 22)",

    "character":"Lady Rokuj\u014d",
    "bio":"(Rokuj\u014d no miyasudokoro) \u2013 She is a lady of high birth and Genji's senior by seven years. Introduced in the tale narrative in chapter four, \u201cY\u016bgao,\u201d as Genji's lover, Rokuj\u014d is not mentioned in any of the previous chapters. Nevertheless, the later narrative does clarify certain biographical aspects related to this lady. Thus, she is the widow of a former Crown Prince (presumably one of Emperor Kiritsubo's brothers) and would have become an empress, if not for her husband's untimely death. Because of her outstanding social position, she is entitled to be treated with the utmost respect, a fact which Genji, too caught up in his philandering, neglects to do. Humiliated by Genji's disrespect for her, angered and jealous by the rumors of his affairs, Rokuj\u014d becomes the perfect candidate for being the possessing spirit behind Y\u016bgao's demise, at least in traditional interpretations of the tale. Her identification as possessing spirit is further reinforced in the \u201cAoi\u201d chapter, where several clues seem to make her the culprit in Aoi's possession and death. Troubled by the gossip about her involvement in Aoi's possession, Rokuj\u014d herself comes to believe in her own guilt. As a result, she decides to follow her daughter, appointed as Priestess, to Ise. After her return to the capital, she entrusts her daughter, Akikonomu, to Genji and dies in chapter fourteen, \u201cMiotsukushi.\u201d Following her death, she keeps being identified as the spirit inflicting torment upon Genji's women, Murasaki and the Third Princess to be exact. (chapters 4\u201314; as the presumed possessing spirit, chapters 35,36)",

She makes her debut into the tale as a substitute for her unattainable aunt, but she gradually outshines Fujitsubo in Genji's and the readers\u2019 eyes, turning into \u201ca substitute for all seasons.\u201d [ 2 ] : 160 In fact, her very name, \u201cMurasaki\u201d translated as \u201cLavender,\u201d plays on the similarity of two colors (the color \u201cmurasaki\u201d is purple of a darker hue than \u201cfuji\u201d, wisteria, of Fujitsubo's name). Discovered by Genji in the Northern Hills when she is only ten, she is taken into his Nij\u014d residence after the death of her grandmother (the episode of her kidnapping has definite violent undertones) where she is molded into Genji's ideal woman, not unlike the myth of Galatea, with whom she is often compared. [ 8 ] She remains Genji's most important lover throughout the tale, but, because of her imperfect social status (she is of royal blood on her father's side, but her mother was a commoner), she can never be acknowledged as Genji's main wife (kita no kata). For that reason, her position is perpetually insecure, especially when Genji's attention shifts to other women including Akashi, Asagao, but most importantly, the Third Princess. Childless her entire life, Murasaki can only adopt Genji's daughter by the Akashi Lady and raise her to become an empress. Towards the end of her life, she repeatedly expresses her desire to become a nun, but meets Genji's resolute opposition. She becomes the victim of spirit possession in chapter 35 (the aggressor is once more identified as Rokuj\u014d, though this interpretation has been debated [ 5 ] ) and dies in chapter 40 without having realized her wish. Murasaki as a character of the Genji has triggered much debate among scholars. Some see her as an utterly miserable character, [ 8 ] while others claim that her relationship with Genji is the best things that could have happened to a woman of Murasaki's status. [ 9 ] The beauty of this character resides precisely in its complexity. (chapters 5\u201340)",

Even so, after the grandmother's death, Sh\u014dnagon is not high-ranking enough to oppose Genji's plans and, faced with the decision of either to follow her young mistress to Genji's Nij\u014d (at the risk of being accused of kidnapping by Prince Hy\u014dbu, once he finds out the girl is missing) or to abandon her, she takes the first choice. Later, impressed by Genji's social standing as well as by the care he devotes to Murasaki, Sh\u014dnagon is quite happy with her decision. As Murasaki ages, Sh\u014dnagon slips out of the narrative unnoticed. (chapters 4\u201312)",

as he has roundly told me he knows as well as the rest of us so what he is after i cannot for the life of me imagine only to day when prince hyobukyo was here he bade me keep a sharp eye upon her and not let her be treated with any indiscretion i confess when he said it i remembered with vexation certain liberties which i have allowed your master to take thinking little enough of them at the time ' 'but by acting so hastily you will do yourself no good and leave the poor servants here in a sad pickle ' 'i hear ' said genji now coming forward 'that the child is to be moved to her father's and i have something of importance which i must say to her before she goes ' ' see i am only rousing the child and bending over her the morning mist is rising he cried it is time to wake ' 'never mind whether it is your father or i ' he cried 'it is all the same' ' well cried out koremitsu and shonagon in astonishment ' 'it seems ' said genji 'that you were disquieted at my telling you i could not visit her here as often as i wished and would make arrangements for her to go to a more convenient place i hear that you are sending her where' o sir ' you could not have chosen a worse time to day her father is coming to fetch her and whatever shall i say to him if only you would wait i am sure it would all come right in the end but by acting so hastily you will do yourself no good and leave the poor servants here in a sad pickle ' 'whatever business you have to transact with her i am sure she will give the matter her closest attention ' you cannot go in there ' several aged ladies are lying all undressed 'o sir you could not have chosen a worse time to day her father is coming to fetch her and whatever shall i say to him if only you would wait i am sure it would all come right in the end but by acting so hastily you will do yourself no good and leave the poor servants here in a sad pickle ' come ' said genji while he put her hair to rights 'your father has sent me to bring you back with me to his palace ' it seems ' said genji 'that you were disquieted at my telling you i could not visit her here as often as i wished and would make arrangements for her to go to a more convenient place i hear that you are sending her where it will be even more difficult for me to see her therefore make ready one or the other of you to come with me ' 'o sir ' she said 'you could not have chosen a worse time to day her father is coming to fetch her and whatever shall i say to him if only you would wait i am sure it would all come right in the end but by acting so hastily you will do yourself no good and leave the poor servants here in a sad pickle ' 'if only you would wait i am sure it would all come right in the end but by acting so hastily you will do yourself no good and leave the poor servants here in a sad pickle ' 'i want to sleep with shonagon ' she said at last in a tearful babyish voice 'come' said genji while she was admiring it 'you must write something too ' 'i cannot write properly yet' she answered looking up at him with a witchery so wholly unconscious that genji laughed ' oh i have spoiled it she suddenly cried out and blushing hid from him what she had written ' 'from to day onwards you are a grown up lady ' 'i will get them mended for you come you must not cry on new year s day ' 'from to day onwards you are a grown up lady ' what a tiresome child he is ' 'you can behave like a nice little grown up lady or he will get tired of waiting ' 'what a tiresome child he is ' 'i will get them mended for you come you must not cry on new year's day ' 'this flower decked day of meeting when the great god unfolds part i doubt whether he will find much comfort in such visits ' 'who had been at such pains to make these dainty and ingenious cakes ' no doubt ' thought she 'prince genji has come as usual to hear her repeat her lessons ' 'who had been at such pains to make these dainty and ingenious cakes '",

At one time, she was the intended of Suzaku, but was raped by a drunk Genji in Chapter 8 (after a party held by the Emperor to honor the cherry tree in front of the Shishinden). After meeting again at her father's party several weeks later, Oborozukiyo falls in love with Genji, and they have a secret relationship. The discovery of this relationship, which continues after Oborozukiyo enters court for Suzaku during the early years of his reign as emperor, is one of the catalysts for Genji's exile.",

been done i shall make you the lord of this earth and not betray my promise ' 'tell your king this your arrogant attempt to cow me with your words provokes contempt if you are persia s sovereign lord if you are like a lion in all you think and do iam seen from beginning to end ' 'every man has his uses and i asked olad to be an honest guide for me which he was i encouraged him to hope for

of all the world your body i shall thrust beneath the dirt 'o lionhearted walrrior two armies are watching us and if i let them see my face and hair your troops will be very amused by the notion of your fighting with a mere girl we d better draw aside somewhere that s what a wise man would do so that you won t be a laughing stock before these two armies ' 'o king of all the asian hordes turn

    "bio":"Rudabeh is the daughter of Mihrab, the ruler of Kabul, and mother of Rustam. Mihrab, one of the grandson's of Zahhak, paid tribute to Saam who had been appointed by Manuchehr as the governor of Sistan. One day Zal, traveling with his champions to India, arrives in Kabul. Mihrab welcomes him and invites him to be a guest at his house. Meanwhile, one of Zal's companions, speaks well about Rudabeh, especially about her beauty, so much so that Zal falls in love with her. When Mihrab talks about Zal to his wife, Sindukht, his daughter Rudabeh overhears them. She, too, falls in love with Zal. Meanwhile Rudabeh sends a message to Zal and receives an answer. One night, Zal enters Rudabeh's bedchamber and the two become acquainted. Finally, the couple decide to marry.Zal requests permission from his father, Saam, to marry Rudabeh. Saam agrees but goes to the court of Manuchehr for permission. In Kabul, Mihrab, hearing about what had transpired between Zal and Rudabeh, becomes very angry and wants to kill his daughter; his wife, Sindukht, intervenes.When Zal comes to the court of Manuchehr, he is ordered to invade Kabul. Hearing this news, Mihrab becomes angry again, and again he wants to kill his wife and his daughter. Rudabeh calms her father down. Then, she herself goes to Saam and discusses the matter with him. Zal, too, goes to Saam and requests that rather than invade Kabul, he (Zal) should be killed. Consequently, Saam dispatches Zal with a letter to Manuchehr. After consulting with his astrologers, Manuchehr approves the marriage between Zal and Rudabeh. Rustam is born from this marriage. The birth is a difficult one (see Rustam, Simurgh, Zal, for further details).After the death of Rustam, Rudabeh loses consciousness but soon after, with loving care, she returns to good health. After the death of Faramarz, Rudabeh curses the House of Gushtasp. Pashutan, Gushtasp's son and the minister of Bahman, who had killed Faramarz, is filled with fear at Rudabeh's curse. He requests from Bahman to forgive the family of Zal and allow Rustam's family to return to Zabulistan.",

was crowned by her musky hair ' 'may evil never harm you open your lovely lips and tell us where have you been today ' 'rudabeh s red lips smiled and turning her saffron cheeks to them she said if you bring us to one another s arms and keep the promise you have made you will be planting a noble tree whose daily fruit will be rubies ' 'rudabeh went onto the roof and stood there like a cypress tree topped by the full moon ' 'come take these black locks which i let down for you and use them to climb up to me ' rudabeh replied 'and i too swear before god and may he witness what i say that no one shall be my master but zal the world s hero the crowned prince on his throne the lord of beauty and royal splendor ' 'come take these black locks which i let down for you and use them to climb up to me ' 'rudabeh made her obeisance before him then grasped his hands in hers ' 'so tightly they embraced before zal left zal was the warp and rudabeh the weft of one cloth as with tears they said goodbye' ' and i too swear before god and may he witness what i say that no one shall be my master but zal the world s hero the crowned prince on his throne the lord of beauty and royal splendor ' she replied 'i left both of them with rudabeh she wanted some other things so i'm going to fetch them ' 'rudabeh said she would pay me tomorrow ' 'she gave her a muslin headscarf that was so finely woven

' 'my heart s consumed by passion and desire ' 'the letter that he sent to zal was brought to me here by the woman whom you caught ' 'rudabeh was ashamed and stared at the ground she began to weep and tears coursed down her lovely cheeks ' i wish i'd not been born and then you would see nothing evil in me nothing good 'i shall make a river of blood of rudabeh this moment ' the heavens do not always turn as we would wish know then that zal sam's son has set who knows what snares in secret to catch rudabeh 'you senseless child when was such behavior ever right for a noblewoman how can a fairy being like you marry that ahriman ' 'bring rudabeh to me ' 'you senseless child when was such behavior ever right for a noblewoman how can a fairy being like you marry that ahriman ' rudabeh replied 'you are the king's consort and worthy of praise from everyone the dust beneath your feet is my pillow and your commands are my soul's comfort may the eye of ahriman be far from you and your heart and soul always be filled with joy ' rudabeh replied 'you are the king's consort and worthy of praise from everyone the dust beneath your feet is my pillow and your commands are my soul's comfort may the

He, therefore, asks for her hand and marries her. The king of Hamavaran decides to eliminate Kayka'us but Sudabeh intervenes. When this does not work, she informs Kayka'us of her father' intentions.

as if she could never grow weary of him ' 'pay a visit to my womenfolk stay with them for a while and let them honor you ' 'throughout the day and for three watches of the night i thank god a hundred

had given him of our daughter and all the treasure that was to be his and i said i d add more in gifts to the bride but he said he wanted only me and that without me girls and treasure were nothing to

to him day and night the memory of this tormented him and he said nothing ' 'thirdly she was a loving woman and he felt she should be forgiven for her faults and fourthly he had young children by her

of her response he went to sudabeh and informed her of what the astrologers had said but sudabeh s reply was that they only said this because they were afraid of seyavash ' 'she added that even if he

with execution and that if she still stayed silent she be sawn in two but her only reply was that she was innocent and did not know what to say ' 'she wept more water than the sun draws up from the nile and kavus wept with her ' sudabeh's answer was that she had demonstrated seyavash's guilt by producing the two miscarried babies and that he should undergo the trial as he had acted evilly and

punishment for what you have done ' 'bowing before her one by one' 'and listening to her kavus once again began to turn against his son but for the moment he concealed his suspicions ' now surely she'll accept good guidance and reform her ways but i want you to harbor no resentment against me in your heart so let seyavash tell the truth it was zal's magic that saved him 'i should fight this

        "'honoured gentlemen my beloved brothers the woods and meadows alone are the hunter s forum therefore such matters i will not pass upon within doors but i will dissolve our sitting until to morrow and will not permit further argument from either faction to day ' 'who among us does not remember the years when as a young lad with his gun on his shoulder he went whistling into the fields where no rampart no fence blocked his path ' thaddeus said 'telimena my dear i am afraid that our count will not come to us this year ' 'ah yes ' replied telimena 'he has an excellent knowledge of the chase he has often discoursed of the proper time and places for hunting ' 'it is no wonder sir ' called the steward from the room at the left 'pax pax pax vobiscum peace be with you ' 'but now my dear pray observe my distress ' 'he refuses to return home god knows where he is hiding ' 'are you a god fearing man so you think that you will really be doing a good turn to thaddeus if you make a sower of buckwheat out of the young man you will close the world to him believe me some time he will curse you ' 'ha ha that is a new idea ' 'ha ha that is a new idea ' 'but as for zosia what have you men to do with zosia ' 'i control her hand i alone ' 'ha ha that is a new idea ' 'i don t care anything about thaddeus plan for him yourselves make him a steward or put him in a tavern let him be a bar tender or bring game for your table from the woods do with him whatever you wish ' 'to be sure zosia will not be a wealthy match but yet she is not a common village girl a simple gentleman s daughter her ancestors were called your grace she is the child of a wojewoda her mother was a horeszko she will get a husband ' 'i do not refuse him my dear brother not at all ' 'only do not be angry sister if you do not agree sister you are quite within your rights ' 'much have i injured you and much do i owe to you ' 'much have i injured you and much do i owe to you ' 'much have i dared and more will i dare ' 'bravo i congratulate you ' she said 'you have no small talent only do not neglect it above all you need to search out a beautiful environment ' 'that count is the land of painters ' 'with these thoughts telimena rose from the sofa and stood on tiptoe ' 'she opened slightly her gown over her bosom leaned sideways surveyed herself with a diligent eye and again asked counsel of her mirror

tiptoe ' 'she opened slightly her gown over her bosom leaned sideways surveyed herself with a diligent eye and again asked counsel of her mirror ' 'men of property are changeable in their tastes ' 'if

times up and down the chamber again she lowered her brow ' 'why to day you are beginning your fourteenth year it is time to give up turkeys and hens ' 'and you walk and move like a village girl ' 'from now on i shall see that all this is changed ' 'see that you do not cause me shame ' 'he doesn't know what he is talking about himself he is a little tired of sitting in the chamber the judge

nobody to dance with ' 'but just wait auntie till i ve lived among other people for a little while you ll see how i improve ' 'you would have learned fine manners from them ' 'now at all events there is some one to show yourself to ' 'what lay upon his heart he himself could not guess he felt himself very unhappy he had recognised zosia by her stature and her bright hair and her voice ' 'without saying a word he spat kicked away his chair and bolted from the room ' 'stupid how is she to blame if i deceived myself ' 'are you well why are you so gloomy ' 'telimena arose in wrath and with sharp words began to shower on him sarcasms and reproaches ' 'stupid how is she to blame if i deceived myself ' 'she seized herself by the breast the neck the soles of her feet her knees ' 'with sharp words began to shower on him sarcasms and reproaches ' 'as a pike when a fisherman s spear pierces through its breast plunges and dives thinking to escape but everywhere drags with it the iron and the line

away and shake herself finally to sit down on the grass and catch the insects ' 'it seemed to telimena that once from behind a bush shone the thin cowled face of robak ' 'he took pity he felt that compassion moved him ' 'oh what torture i am suffering ' 'telimena was sitting in the middle of the pathway ' 'telimena was forced to run away and shake herself finally to sit down on the grass and catch the insects ' 'telimena was sitting half turned away from thaddeus and in her confusion hardly dared to glance at him ' 'he's showing off ' 'telimena had come back from the wood in too much of a hurry and had not had time to repair her colouring ' 'so the eyes of thaddeus like cunning spies having discovered one piece of treason began to explore one after another her remaining charms and everywhere discovered some falsity ' 'telimena had come back from the wood in too much of a hurry and had not had time to repair her colouring ' 'but the assessor had still more recent reasons for chagrin when he gazed at telimena and at his rivals ' 'telimena was sitting half turned away from thaddeus ' 'telimena had come back from the wood in too much of a hurry and had not had time to repair her colouring ' 'telimena had come back from the wood in too much of a hurry and had not had time to repair her colouring ' 'ah who can control his heart ' 'it was evident however despite such skilful deception that he was flirting merely to spite telimena ' 'i drink the health of robak seneschal clink your glass with mine ' fool you cub of a count i'll teach you thomas my sabre i'll teach you _mores_ you fool get to hell out of here respects and offices wound your delicate ears i'll pay you up right off over your pretty earrings get out of the door draw your sword thomas my sabre 'hold sir this is our affair i was challenged first protazy my hanger i will make him dance like a bear on a pole ' 'she is intriguing and seems to be flirting with thaddeus i have my eye on her or perhaps she is aiming at the count perhaps at both at once ' 'you would have borne witness how fearfully the count insulted me ' 'how did it happen tell me ' 'reconcile what do you mean go to the devil with your reconciliation ' 'you are a liar foh i ll look into your case pan thaddeus i ll make your ears smart for you ' 'speak the truth you wish to desert me ' 'let me know that my thaddeus loves me let me hear once more from your lips the words i love let me grave them in my heart and write them in my thoughts ' 'telimena so may god s bright lightning strike me if it be not true that i have been fond of you yes that i have loved you deeply ' 'no never ' 'let s drop the matter i beg you my dear bethink yourself be calm ' 'farewell my telimena i leave to morrow ' 'to morrow i depart ' 'i have already made my resolution and with heaven s aid telimena i shall not change it ' telimena so may god's bright lightning strike me if it be not true that i have been fond of you yes that i have loved

corner of the world will be charming ' 'no never ' 'your arts will no longer corrupt others as they have corrupted me ' 'away i despise you ' 'away i despise you you are a liar a base man ' 'idiotic woman ' ' and what of that perhaps the count sincerely loves zosia perhaps she loves him and will choose him for her husband by what right could i desire to break off that marriage and unhappy myself to destroy the happiness of every one ' 'love me or not get married or depart only stop ' 'vainly telimena joined her entreaties to the tears of zosia that they should have more regard for the captives ' ' on the word of a major madam i am not a russian if i lie may i be the son of a bitch if i lie ask and all the officers will bear witness all the army will tell you that in the second army ninth corps second division of infantry fiftieth yager regiment major plut is the foremost dancer of the mazurka come on young lady don t be so skittish for i shall punish you in officer s fashion ' 'so saying he jumped up seized telimena s hand and imprinted a broad kiss on her white shoulder ' 'may the lord god guide you in health and happiness and may he soon guide you back prosperously to us ' 'panna sophia now i must bid you good bye farewell do not forget me and deign sometimes to repeat a prayer for me sophia ' ' who hinders you from loving and being happy inquired telimena ' ' the power of my destiny said the count mysterious forebodings that with a secret impulse urge me to foreign lands and to unwonted deeds i confess that to day i wished in honour of telimena to light the flame on the altars of hymen but this youth has given me too fair an example by tearing off his marriage wreath of his own free will and rushing to test his heart amid the hindrances of changeful fortune and amid the bloody chances of war ' 'alas i see that nothing will restrain you ' 'may these colours guide you against fiery cannon against shining spears and sulphurous rains and when you make yourself famous by warlike deeds and when you shade with immortal laurels your blood stained helmet and your casque bold in victory even then look once more on this cockade remember whose hand pinned upon you these colours ' 'she had been taught by telimena how to curtsy gracefully' 'suffice it to say that this morning for the first time in her life zosia had been scolded for obstinacy by telimena' 'ah man of easy faith why have i worn these ribbons '",

ever since she was small ' 'but if a well trained grown up young lady suddenly appears glittering before the world from no one knows where then everybody crowds up to her out of curiosity observes all

does not like her ' 'hurry up for at any minute they may come home from hunting ' 'telimena opened her st petersburg stores and took forth bottles of perfumes and jars of pomade ' 'then the

polite to him ' 'note well zosia we have here a young count a gentleman well educated a relative of the wojewoda see that you are polite to him ' 'telimena discharged the duties of hostess greeted

locked me up auntie there was nobody to dance with to pass the time away i liked to feed the birds and to pet the children but just wait auntie till i've lived among other people for a little while you'll see how i improve ' 'note well zosia we have here a young count a gentleman knows where then everybody crowds up to her out of curiosity observes all her movements each glance of her eye attends to her words and repeats them to others ' 'well zosia make your toilet get the things from my desk you will find ready everything needed for dressing ' 'unhappy me zosia you see what comes of' 'zosia curtsied politely ' 'o auntie ' said zosia sadly 'how am i to blame ' 'are you well why are you so gloomy ' 'how am i to blame you have locked me up auntie there was nobody to dance with to pass the time away i liked to feed the birds and to pet the children but just wait auntie till i ve lived among other people for a little while you ll see how i improve ' 'zosia curtsied politely he bowed low wanted to say something to her and had already opened his lips but when he looked into zosia s eyes he was so abashed ' 'are you well why are you so gloomy ' 'zosia curtsied politely ' he looked into zosia's eyes he was so abashed that standing dumb before her he first flushed and then grew pale 'thaddeus took his stand in the corner and leaned on the mantel without saying a word his wide open wandering eyes he turned now on the aunt and now on the niece ' 'are you well why are you so gloomy ' she asked him she pressed her questions she hinted about zosia and began to jest with him 'are you well why are you so gloomy ' 'filled her glass and passed plates to her saying a thousand' for heaven's sake she was rouged 'zosia seeing the assault leapt up and filled with pity sheltered the old man' 'i am sick already of seeing so many acts of folly i have more important business than to reconcile litigious squabblers ' 'he will certainly die of despair ' i committed folly enough by your advice when i convoked for the third time the chamberlain's court 'father you may kill me but i must go there ' 'what s the matter with you ' 'i have taken a great liking to that little girl zosia your ward though i have seen her only a couple of times ' 'but what should you say if i helped you to obtain zosia hey ' 'ah my hopes are vain for pani telimena will not yield me zosia ' 'no one can prevail upon her ' 'i have taken a great liking to that little girl zosia your ward though i have seen her only a couple of times ' 'but what should you say if i helped you to obtain zosia hey ' 'you shall marry zosia otherwise the horsewhip to morrow you shall stand before the altar ' 'i have taken a great liking to that little girl zosia your ward though i have seen her only a couple of times ' 'what should you say if i helped you to obtain zosia hey ' 'i tell you that you shall marry zosia ' 'whether you like it or not i tell you that you shall marry zosia ' 'so what about that child zosia ' 'away i despise you ' 'i must slay the count the scoundrel ' 'away i despise you you are a liar a base man ' 'away i despise you you are a liar a base man ' 'i must slay the count the scoundrel ' 'he went up to zosia and bowing and tottering invited her to open the mazurka ' 'question me no further ' 'but the curious zosia from the depths of the alcove had been following this mysterious conversation through a crack she had heard thaddeus tell frankly and boldly of his love and with fluttering heart she had seen those two great tears in his eyes ' 'then on my knees i shall greet my dear zosia and if she is free i shall beg her hand ' 'preserved till now my plighted faith and without ever having been a husband i am now an old widower though the seneschal has another daughter very fair and very like my beloved marta ' 'but now i am abandoning lithuania perhaps for long and perhaps in the meantime another man may win zosia s favour ' 'i do not wish to bind her will and to beg for an affection that i have not deserved would be a base act ' 'zosia stood there silent with' 'time is like a blast of wind it extinguishes only the little candle a great flame it fans to an even mightier conflagration ' 'and yet i was _not_ a traitor to my country ' 'i fled from my country where have i not been what have i not suffered ' 'since the attack that bloodthirsty buzzard dobrzynski had made on the hencoop at the time of the foray when he had annihilated zosia s establishment' 'i too will tell you sir something which though not so marvellous as that omen is nevertheless hard to understand ' 'i did not accept your promise then for what did i care for such a forced promise ' 'perhaps you are taking me zosia not so much from attachment as because your uncle and aunt are urging you to do so ' 'but marriage zosia is a very serious matter take counsel of your own heart and do not hearken to any one s authority either to your uncle s threats or to your aunt s entreaties ' 'well my beloved zosia ' 'i do not now remember perfectly what happened so long ago ' 'i did not accept your promise then for what did i care for such a forced promise ' 'take counsel of your own heart and do not hearken to any one s authority either to your uncle s threats or to your aunt s entreaties ' 'well my beloved zosia ' 'later the chamberlain s wife went to wilno and took me there for the winter but i longed for soplicowo and for that little room where you met me for the first time one evening by the table and where you later bade me farewell ' 'i did not accept your promise then for what did i care for such a forced promise ' 'perhaps you are taking me zosia not so much from attachment as because your uncle and aunt are urging you to do so ' 'well my beloved zosia ' 'i do not now remember perfectly what happened so long ago ' 'whenever i have uttered a prayer for your success i have always had before my eyes the picture of you with those great shining

do so ' 'let us wait zosia ' 'i do not now remember perfectly what happened so long ago ' 'whenever i have uttered a prayer for your success i have always had before my eyes the picture of you with

shining tears ' 'so now if i love any one it must surely be you ' 'some asked zosia to raise her head and show her eyes others begged her to be so kind as to turn around the bashful girl turned around but covered her eyes with her hands ' 'then general kniaziewicz took her by the shoulders and imprinting a fatherly kiss on her brow lifted the girl aloft and set her on the table ' 'zosia curtsied once more to all in turn her cheeks glowing ' 'on her brow as is the custom with reapers she had fastened a curved sickle freshly polished by cutting grasses bright as the new moon above the brow of diana ' 'some asked zosia to raise her head and show her eyes others begged her to be so kind as to turn around the bashful girl turned around but covered her eyes with her hands ' 'by instinct for a girl always guesses by instinct what is becoming to her suffice it to say that this morning for the first time in her life zosia had been scolded for obstinacy by telimena since she had refused to put on fashionable attire at last by her tears she had prevailed on them to let her remain in this village costume ' 'whatever you arrange i agree to with all my heart ' 'how he had loved to bring her flowers to plait little baskets to gather birds nests to make little earrings ' 'in vain did the chamberlain strive to remain by her side ' 'how he had loved to bring her flowers to plait little baskets to gather birds nests to make little earrings ' 'in vain did the chamberlain strive to remain by her side ' how he had loved to bring her flowers to plait little baskets to gather birds' nests

flowers unseen in her flight guiding the dance as an angel guides the motion of the stars by night ' 'she went to the table to pour wine for the guests ' 'zosia'",

        "'he was like _kandarpa_ himself in his embodied form and moved by admiration the heralds again and again celebrated the praises of nala before damayanti and those of damayanti before the ruler of the nishadhas ' 'and damayanti in the midst of her maids beholding those birds of extraordinary appearance was filled with delight and strove without loss of time to catch those coursers of the skies ' vrihadaswa said 'o bharata hearing those words of the swan damayanti thenceforth lost all peace of mind on account of nala ' 'and she ceased to lie down by day or night always weeping with exclamation of _oh _ and _alas _' 'and hearing those words of the swan damayanti thenceforth lost all peace of mind on account of nala ' 'and beholding her uneasy and fallen into that condition her hand maids represented o king the matter of her illness unto the ruler of vidarbha by indirect hints ' 'why is it that my daughter seemeth to be so ill now ' 'and damayanti thenceforth lost all peace of mind on account of nala ' 'and with her heart possessed by the god of love she soon lost colour and with her upturned gaze and modes of abstraction looked like one demented ' 'and she ceased to lie down by day or night always weeping with exclamation of _oh _ and _alas _' 'and beholding her uneasy and fallen into that condition her hand maids represented o king the matter of her illness unto the ruler of vidarbha by indirect hints ' the ruler of the vidarbhas hath a daughter the celebrated damayanti in beauty she transcendeth all the women of the earth her _swayamvara_ o sakra will take place shortly thither are going all the kings and princes from all directions and all the lords of the earth desire to have that pearl his daughter had attained to puberty concluded that damayanti's _swayamvara_ should take place thus addressed by those celestials the ruler of nishadhas spake again saying 'those mansions are well guarded how can i hope to enter them ' 'and having arrived there he beheld the daughter of the king of vidarbha surrounded by her hand maids blazing in beauty and excelling in symmetry of form of limbs exceedingly delicate of slender waist and fair eyes ' 'and that sacred assembly of kings graced by those tigers among men resembled the _bhogavati_ swarming with the nagas or a mountain cavern with tigers ' 'and when o bharata the names of the monarchs were proclaimed the daughter of bhima saw five persons all alike in appearance ' 'and thinking thus the daughter of vidarbha became filled with grief ' and o bharata recollecting the marks belonging to the celestials of which she had heard she thought 'those attributes of the celestials of which i have heard from the aged do not pertain to any of these deities present here upon the earth ' 'and revolving the matter long in her mind and reflecting upon it repeatedly she decided upon seeking the protection of the gods themselves ' 'since i heard the speech of the swans i chose the king of the nishadhas as my lord for the sake of truth o let the gods reveal him to me and as in thought or word i have never swerved from him o let the gods for the sake of that truth reveal him to me and as the gods themselves have destined the ruler of the nishadhas to be my lord o let them for the sake of that truth reveal him to me and as it is for paying homage unto nala that i have adopted this vow for the sake of that truth o let the gods reveal him unto me o let the exalted guardians of the worlds assume their own proper forms so that i may know the righteous king ' and comforted the beauteous damayanti saying 'since thou o blessed one hast chosen a mortal in the presence of the celestials know me for a husband even obedient to thy command ' 'damayanti also with folded hands paid homage unto nala in words of like import ' and comforted the beauteous damayanti saying 'since thou o blessed one hast chosen a mortal in the presence of the celestials know me for a husband even obedient to thy command ' 'damayanti also with folded hands paid homage unto nala in words of like import ' and o kauravya the royal son of virasena with heart filled with gladness comforted the beauteous damayanti saying 'since thou o blessed one hast chosen a mortal in the presence of the celestials know me for a husband even obedient to thy command ' 'damayanti also with folded hands paid homage unto nala in words of like import ' 'and having attained that pearl of a woman the virtuous king o monarch began to pass his days in joy like the slayer of vala and vritra in the company of sachi and resembling the sun in glory the king full of gladness began to rule his subjects righteously and give them great satisfaction ' comforted the beauteous damayanti saying 'since thou o blessed one hast chosen a mortal in the presence of the celestials know me for ' 'and like unto a very god nala sported with damayanti in romantic woods and groves ' 'finding her husband disregarding her words damayanti filled with shame returned to her apartments ' and the blameless daughter of bhima acquainted with conduct suitable to time and place addressing soft words said according to the occasion 'thou knowest how the king hath always behaved towards thee he is now in difficulty and it behoveth thee to assist him ' 'well if thou likest that damayanti be our stake now ' 'o king thinking of thy purpose my heart trembleth and all my limbs become faint how can i go leaving thee in the lone woods despoiled of thy kingdom and deprived of thy wealth thyself without a garment on and worn with hunger and toil when in the deep woods fatigued and afflicted with hunger thou thinkest of thy former bliss i will o great monarch soothe thy weariness in every sorrow there is no physic equal unto the wife say the physicians it is the truth o nala that i speak unto thee ' 'o faultless one they through whose anger i have been despoiled of my kingdom they through whose influence distressed and afflicted with hunger i am unable to procure sustenance they for whom the nishadhas offered me not any hospitality they o timid one are carrying off my cloth assuming the form of birds ' addressing bhima's daughter o bharata the distressed king nala spake those words unto damayanti over and over again 'how can i go leaving thee in the lone woods despoiled of thy kingdom and deprived of thy wealth thyself without a garment on and worn with hunger and toil ' 'it is the truth o nala that i speak unto thee ' 'o mighty king intend to forsake me why then dost thou point out to me the way to the country of the vidarbhas ' thus spake unto damayanti 'o faultless one' addressing bhima's daughter o bharata the distressed king nala spake those words unto damayanti over and over again 'thereupon afflicted with grief in a voice choked with tears damayanti spake unto naishadha these piteous words' 'the innocent and delicate damayanti with every mark of good fortune fell into a profound slumber ' 'saying this again and again unto damayanti king nala wrapped in half a garment comforted his blessed wife ' 'and wearing the same piece of cloth with damayanti and dirty and haggard and stained with dust he fell asleep with damayanti on the ground in weariness ' 'of high fame and auspicious fortune and devoted to me her husband she is incapable of being injured by any one on the way on account of her energy ' 'and suddenly plunged in distress the innocent and delicate damayanti with every mark of good fortune fell into a profound slumber ' 'of high fame and auspicious fortune and devoted to me her husband she is incapable of being injured by any one on the way on account of her energy ' and then thinking of his own want of clothing and of her being clad in a single garment he intended to cut off for himself one half of damayanti's attire 'but his heart failing him the king of the nishadhas returned to the shed and seeing damayanti again burst' 'that beloved one of mine whom neither the god of wind nor the sun had seen before even she sleepeth to day on the bare earth like one forlorn ' 'devoted as she is to me if she stayeth with me distress will surely be hers while it is doubtful if i desert her ' 'of high fame and auspicious fortune and devoted to me her husband she is incapable of being injured by any one on the way on account of her energy ' and then thinking of his own want of clothing and of her being clad in a single garment he intended to cut off for himself one half of damayanti's attire 'alas that beloved one of mine whom neither the god of wind nor the sun had seen before even she sleepeth to day on the bare earth like one forlorn clad in this severed piece of cloth and lying like one distracted how will the beauteous one of luminous smiles behave when she awaketh ' 'how will the beautiful daughter of bhima devoted to her lord all alone and separated from me wander through these deep woods inhabited by beasts and serpents ' 'of high fame and auspicious fortune and devoted to me her husband she is incapable of being injured by any one on the way on account of her energy ' 'how shall i divide this garment so that my beloved one may not perceive ' 'o lord o mighty monarch o husband dost thou desert me oh i am lost and undone frightened in this desolate place ' 'that thy wife liveth even a moment after thy desertion of her is only because mortals are decreed to die at the appointed time ' 'o bull among men enough of this joke ' 'o irrepressible one i am terribly frightened ' 'i see thee i see thee o king thou art seen o naishadha ' and damayanti already distressed upon being deprived of husband and kingdom in that hour of grief beyond utterance cursed him in anger saying 'i have never even thought of any other person than naishadha therefore let this mean minded wretch subsisting on chase fall down lifeless ' and she said 'o lord why dost thou not rush towards me now that i am seized without anybody to protect me by this serpent in these desert wilds and o naishadha how will it fare with thee when thou rememberest me ' 'thus accosted o monarch by that man damayanti o bharata related unto him all that had happened ' and damayanti already distressed upon being deprived of husband and kingdom in that hour of grief beyond utterance cursed him in anger saying 'i have never even thought of any other person than naishadha therefore let this mean minded wretch subsisting on chase fall down lifeless ' 'o tiger among men played false with me alone ' 'o best of men o thou of great splendour it behoveth thee o auspicious one to remember what thou didst declare before me o bull among kings ' 'oh wherefore dost thou not answer me ' 'thou wert wont to say always _save thee there existeth not one dear unto me_ ' 'that best of women the innocent and blessed damayanti with graceful eye brows and long tresses with lovely hips and deep bosom and face graced with fine teeth and with fine black and large eyes in her brightness and glory entered that asylum ' 'tell us o blameless o foremost of mountains with thy hundreds of peaks towering into the sky seen king nala in this frightful forest hast thou seen my husband that ruler of the nishadhas the illustrious nala with the tread of a mighty elephant endued with intelligence long armed and of fiery energy possessed of prowess and patience and courage and high fame ' 'o king i am frightened do thou o virtuous one comfort me ' 'engaged in the worship of the gods devoted to the twice born ones the guardian of the line of the nishadhas of mighty energy possessed of great strength truthful conversant with all duties wise unwavering in promise the crusher of foes devout serving the gods graceful the conqueror of hostile towns that foremost of kings nala by name equal in splendour unto the lord of celestials the slayer of foes possessed of large eyes and a hue resembling the full moon is my husband ' 'that king devoted to faith and religion was summoned to dice by certain deceitful persons of mean mind and uncultured soul and of crooked ways and skilful in gambling and was deprived of wealth and kingdom ' 'know that i am the wife of that bull among kings known to all by the name of damayanti anxious to find out my missing lord ' unto bhima's daughter damayanti lamenting forlorn in that forest the truth telling ascetics replied and after thinking so for some time bhima's daughter damayanti of sweet smiles melancholy and afflicted with grief on account of her lord lost the colour of her face again reproaching herself she said 'alas fierce and great is the wrath of god on me peace followeth not in my track ' 'of what misdeed is this the consequence i do not remember that i did ever so little a wrong to any one in thought word or deed ' certainly it is on account of the great sins i had committed in a former life that such calamity hath befallen me _viz_ the loss of my husband's

looketh like a lotus stalk transplanted by adverse fortune from the vidarbha lake and covered with mire in the process and oppressed with grief on account of her husband and melancholy she looketh like the night of the full moon when rahu hath swallowed that luminary or like a stream whose current hath dried up ' 'thus addressed the brahmanas cheerfully went out in all directions seeking nala

damayanti the venerable queen became filled with sorrow ' o beautiful one my house is to thee even as thy father's and this wealth o damayanti is thine as much as mine unrecognised i have still lived

with sorrow 'if thou wishest to do what is agreeable to me do thou without loss of time order a vehicle for i wish to go to the vidarbhas ' 'and soon enough she reached the country of the vidarbhas and all her relatives rejoicing in her arrival received her with respect ' 'thus addressed by damayanti the venerable queen became filled with sorrow and bathed in tears she was unable to give any answer ' damayanti oppressed with grief and distress calling sudeva addressed him o yudhishthira in the presence of her mother saying 'o sudeva go thou to the city of ayodhya ' 'a beautious and virtuous woman should not be angry with one that was deprived by birds of his garment while striving to procure sustenance and who is being consumed with grief ' hearing these words of his i have speedily come here thou hast now heard all do what thou thinkest proper and inform the king of it damayanti with tearful eyes came to her mother and spake unto her in private 'o mother king bhima should not by any means be made acquainted with my purpose ' 'thou hast done me the immense service which none else indeed can do me for owing to that service of thine o thou best of the regenerate ones i shall speedily regain my lost lord ' o sudeva go thou to the city of ayodhya straight as a bird and tell king rituparna living there these words 'bhima's daughter damayanti will hold another _swayamvara_ all the kings and princes are going thither calculating the time i find that the ceremony will take place tomorrow o represser of foes if it is possible for thee go thither without delay tomorrow after the sun hath risen she will choose a second husband as she doth not know whether the heroic nala liveth or not ' 'o mother king bhima should not by any means be made acquainted with my purpose ' 'indeed that girl of slender waist afflicted with grief on my account and with despair will not certainly do anything of the kind when especially she is the mother of offspring by me ' and damayanti said 'because the rattle of his car filling the whole earth gladdens my heart it must be king nala that has come if i do not see nala of face bright as the moon that hero with countless virtues i shall certainly die if i am not clasped today in that hero's thrilling embrace i shall certainly cease to be 'if naishadha with voice deep as that of the clouds doth not come to me today i shall enter into a pyre of golden brilliance ' 'if that foremost of kings powerful as a lion and gifted with the strength of an infuriated elephant doth not present himself before me i shall certainly cease to live ' from these indications suspecting that vahuka was her husband damayanti once more weepingly addressed kesini in soft words saying 'o beauteous one go thou once more and bring from the kitchen without vahuka's knowledge some meat that hath been boiled and dressed' 'o damayanti ' 'o beauteous one he touched fire and was not burnt and at his will water falling floweth in a stream and i have witnessed another greater wonder still he took up some flowers began to press them slowly with his hands and pressed by his hand the flowers did not lose their original forms but on the contrary became gayer and more odorous than before ' 'and o bharata overwhelmed with grief and washing her face she sent her two children with kesini ' 'having obtained the consent both of her father and mother damayanti caused nala to be brought to her apartments ' with a sorrowful heart and eager to behold nala again despatched kesini to her mother asking her to say on her behalf 'suspecting vahuka to be nala i have tried him in various ways my doubt now only relates to his appearance i intend to examine him myself o mother either let him enter the palace or give me permission to go to him and arrange this with the knowledge of my father or without it ' 'may the all witnessing air that courseth through this world take my life if i have committed any sin may the sun that ever courseth through the sky take my life if i have committed any sin may the moon that dwelleth within every creature as a witness take my life if i have committed any sin ' 'o nala i tell thee truly that she hath done no wrong o king damayanti well guarding the honour of thy family hath enhanced it ' 'may the all witnessing air that courseth through this world take my life if i have committed any sin may the sun that ever courseth through the sky take my life if i have committed any sin may the moon that dwelleth within every creature as a witness take my life if i have committed any sin ' 'and nala saluted his father in law with becoming humility and after him the fair damayanti paid her respects to her father ' 'let damayanti and all else that i have be my stake' 'and o king it is by good fortune that thou art still alive with thy wife o thou of mighty arms it is evident that damayanti adorned with this wealth of thine that i will win will wait upon me like an apsara in heaven upon indra ' 'and as damayanti was an obedient wife to nala '",

foes and gladdening the hearts of friends and crowned with every blessing ' 'and beholding that mighty wonder the daughter in law of king virasena damayanti of faultless limbs was struck with amazement ' and she asked herself 'was it a dream that i saw what an occurrence hath taken place where are all those ascetics and where is that asylum where further is that delightful river of sacred waters the resort of diverse kinds of fowls and where again are those charming trees decked with fruits and flowers ' 'and going to another part of the wood she saw an _asoka_ tree and approaching that first of trees in the forest so charming with blossoms and its load of foliage and resounding with the notes of birds damayanti with tears in her eyes and accents choked in grief began to lament saying ' 'and hearing these dreadful words of the merchants damayanti in terror and shame and anxiety fled into the woods apprehensive of evil ' 'the crowd of men that i obtained in this lone forest hath been destroyed by a herd of elephants surely as a consequence of my ill luck ' 'i have heard from old men that no person dieth ere his time it is for this that my miserable self hath not been

disregarded for the sake of nala ' 'bewailing thus o tiger among kings that excellent lady damayanti devoted to her husband went oppressed with grief and pale as the autumnal moon ' 'and surrounded by them she came before the palace of the king ' 'she hath fallen into distress and standeth in need of succour i find her beauty to be such that it illumineth my house ' 'the fair one though looking like a maniac seemeth a very _sree_ with her large eyes ' 'and struck with wonder o king she asked damayanti saying ' 'tell me who thou art and whose o thou possessed of celestial splendour surely thy beauty is not human bereft though thou art of ornaments ' 'hearing these words of the nurse the daughter of bhima said ' 'know that i am a female belonging to the human species and devoted to my husband i am a serving woman of good lineage i live wherever i like subsisting on fruit and roots and whom a companion and stay where evening overtaketh me ' 'my husband is the owner of countless virtues and was ever devoted to me and i also on my part was deeply attached to him following him like his shadow ' 'thus passed many days until at last while i was sleeping he cut off half of my cloth and forsook me who had done him no wrong ' 'i am seeking my husband but unable to find him who not been trodden to death by that herd of elephants ' 'and beholding her enter the city of the king of the chedis the boys of the city from curiosity began to follow her ' 'she is forlorn and is being vexed by the crowd she hath fallen into distress and standeth in need of succour ' 'the fair one though looking like a maniac seemeth a beauty that illumineth my house ' 'thus remembering damayanti the king of the nishadhas continued to live unknown in the abode of that monarch ' 'do ye search for nala and also for my daughter damayanti ' 'even if failing to bring damayanti and nala here he that succeeds learning their whereabouts will get from me the wealth represented by a thousand kine '

human or super human thou seest in vahuka together with anything else should all be reported unto me ' 'and thus addressed by damayanti kesini went away and having marked the conduct of that person versed in horse lore she came back ' 'o fair damsel' 'o beauteous one' o beauteous one go thou once more and bring from the kitchen without vahuka's knowledge some meat that hath been boiled and dressed by him 'thus commanded kesini gave that meat o son of the kuru race unto damayanti ' 'and she thereupon decided vahuka to be nala and wept aloud in grief of heart ' 'o fair damsel these twins are very like my own children beholding them unexpectedly i shed tears if thou comest to me frequently people may think evil for we are guests from another land therefore o blessed one go at thy ease ' 'that best of women damayanti also upon beholding king nala in that condition was sorely afflicted with grief ' 'o vahuka hast thou ever seen any person acquainted with duty who hath gone away deserting his sleeping wife in the forest who except the virtuous nala could go away deserting in the woods his dear and unoffending wife overcome with fatigue ' 'o timid one neither the loss of my kingdom nor my desertion of thee was my act both were due to kali and o foremost of virtuous women lamenting for me day and night and overcome with sorrow thou hadst in the woods cursed kali and so he began to dwell in my body burning in consequence of thy curse indeed burning with thy curse he lived within me like fire within fire o blessed girl that our sorrows might terminate that wretch have i overcome by my observances and austerities the sinful wretch hath already left me and it is for this that i have come hither my presence here o fair lady is for thy sake i have no other object ' 'it behoveth thee not o blessed one to suspect any fault in me o ruler of the nishadhas passing over the celestials themselves i choose thee as my lord ' 'when thou hadst returned a fit answer to those words of his it was then o naishadha that i devised this scheme to recover thee ' 'it behoveth thee not o blessed one to suspect any fault in me o ruler of the nishadhas passing over the celestials themselves i choose thee as my lord ' 'at last o king a learned brahmana named parnada had found thee in kosala in the palace of rituparna when thou hadst returned a fit answer to those words of his it was then o naishadha that i devised this scheme to recover thee ' 'let the three gods that sustain the triple worlds in their entirety declare truly or let them forsake me today ' 'of this we are the witnesses as we have been her protectors for these three years ' 'it is for thy good that she hath devised this unrivalled scheme ' thou hast obtained bhima's daughter and she hath also obtained thee 'and beholding those wonders o bharata king nala the represser of foes cast away all his doubts in respect of damayanti ' and beholding her righteous lord in his own form bhima's daughter of faultless limbs embraced him and king nala also embraced bhima's daughter devoted to him as before and also his children and experienced great delight 'and burying her face in his bosom the beauteous damayanti of large eyes began to sigh heavily remembering her griefs ' 'and overwhelmed with sorrow that tiger among men stood for some time clasping the dust covered damayanti of sweet smiles ' 'and o king the queen mother then with a glad heart told bhima all that had passed between nala and damayanti ' 'and damayanti rejoiced exceedingly in having recovered her lord even as fields of tender plants on receiving a shower ' 'and seeing nala arrived the citizens were in great joy and there arose in the city a loud uproar of delight and rituparna heard that vahuka had already been united with damayanti ' 'and o king it is by good fortune that thou art still alive with thy wife o thou of mighty arms it is evident that damayanti adorned with this wealth of thine that i will win will wait upon me like an apsara in heaven upon indra ' it is by good fortune also that damayanti's ill luck hath at last come to an end 'i shall not therefore impute to thee the faults of others ' o naishadha it is by good fortune that thou hast earned wealth again to stake it is by good fortune also that damayanti's ill luck hath at last come to an end 'and o king it is by good fortune that thou art still alive with thy wife o thou of mighty arms it is evident that damayanti adorned with this wealth of thine that i will win will wait upon me like an apsara in heaven upon indra ' joy and without anxiety of any kind the king with a large force brought damayanti from her father's home 'and upon the arrival of the princess of vidarbha accompanied by her son and daughter king nala began to pass his days in joy like the chief of the celestials in the gardens of nandana ' 'this history besides of the naga karkotaka of damayanti of nala and of that royal sage rituparna is destructive of evil '",

the charge her son had laid upon her ' 'she sat herself down before him and with her left hand seized his knees while with her right she caught him under the chin and besought him saying father jove if i ever did you service in word or deed among the immortals hear my prayer and do honour to my son whose life is to be cut short so early ' 'thetis still kept firm hold of his knees and besought him a second time incline your head said she and promise me surely or else deny me for you have nothing to fear that i may learn how greatly you disdain me ' 'the old merman s daughter thetis has been talking you over' 'my mother thetis tells me that there are two ways in which i may meet my end ' 'thetis touched my knees and besought me to give him honour' 'thetis your mother' 'thetis your mother'

strong chest which silver footed thetis had given him to take on board ship ' 'listen ' she cried 'sisters daughters of nereus that you may hear the burden of my sorrows alas woe is me woe in that i have borne the most glorious of offspring ' his mother went up to him as he lay groaning she laid her hand upon his head and spoke piteously saying 'my son why are you thus weeping what sorrow has now

of offspring ' 'my son why are you thus weeping what sorrow has now befallen you tell me hide it not from me ' 'thetis wept and answered then my son is your end near at hand for your own death awaits you full soon after that of hector ' then silver footed thetis answered 'my son what you have said is true it is well to save your comrades from destruction but your armour is in the hands of the trojans hector bears it in triumph upon his own shoulders full well i know that his vaunt shall not be lasting for his end is close at hand 'the same soil shall be reddened here at troy by the blood

make her due requital for having saved me ' 'why have you come to our house thetis honoured and ever welcome for you do not visit us often ' 'say what you want and i will do it for you at once if i can and if it can be done at all ' 'thetis wept and answered vulcan is there another goddess in olympus whom the son of saturn has been pleased to try with so much affliction as he has me ' 'men say that you are son to noble peleus and that your mother is thetis fair haired daughter of the sea ' 'rise thetis jove whose counsels fail not bids you come to him ' 'the goddess took her dark veil than which there can be no robe more sombre and went forth with fleet iris leading the way before her ' 'juno then placed a fair golden cup in her hand and spoke to her in words of comfort whereon thetis drank and gave her back the cup ' 'o lord of the silver bow if you would give like honour to hector and to achilles but hector was mortal and suckled at a woman s breast whereas achilles is the offspring of a goddess whom i myself reared and brought up i married her to peleus who is above measure dear to the immortals you gods came all of you to her wedding you feasted along with them

it a footstool for you to rest your fair feet upon when you are at table ' 'and now you are again asking me to do something on which i cannot venture and juno said sleep why do you take such notions as those into your head do you think jove will be as anxious to help the trojans as he was about his own son ' 'then sleep answered juno great queen of goddesses daughter of mighty saturn i would lull any other of the gods to sleep without compunction not even excepting the waters of oceanus from whom all of them proceed but i dare not go near jove nor send him to sleep unless he bids me ' 'so that all the gods who dwell down below with saturn may be our witnesses and see that you really do give me one of the youngest of the graces pasithea whom i have always wanted to marry ' 'she swore and

of them wrought in gold and clad in golden raiment great and fair with their armour as befitting gods' 'my child you have quite deserted your hero is he then gone so clean out of your recollection there he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss of his dear comrade and though the others are gone to their dinner he will neither eat nor drink go then and drop nectar and ambrosia into his breast that he may know no hunger ' 'minerva and urged him to fall upon the lelegae and trojans ' 'no man may fight achilles for one of the gods is always with him as his guardian angel ' 'minerva had endowed him with great strength' 'may all who help the trojans against the argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart as venus did when she came across me while she was helping mars ' 'father wielder of the lightning lord of cloud and storm' 'thus did he urge minerva who was already eager' 'thus did minerva inveigle him by her cunning' 'then at last as they were nearing the fountains for the fourth time the father of all balanced his golden scales and placed a doom in each of them one for achilles and the other for hector as he held the scales by the middle the doom of hector fell down deep into the house of hades and then phoebus apollo left him thereon minerva went close up to the son of peleus and said noble achilles favoured of heaven we two shall surely take back to the ships a triumph for the achaeans by slaying hector for all his lust of battle do what apollo may as he lies grovelling before his father aegis bearing jove hector cannot escape us longer stay here and take breath while i go up to him and persuade him to make a stand and fight you '",

him but he gave her another ring out of fafnir's hoard 'that same day went brynhild home to her foster father ' 'now the kings fare home but brynhild goes to her father ' 'and at that feast was gunnar wedded to brynhild ' 'brynhild and gunnar sat together in great game and glee and drank goodly wine ' 'a dead woman and she went home and spake no word the evening long ' 'why may she not love her life having wealth and bliss and the praise of all men and the man withal that she would have ' 'i am minded to think that my father is mightier than thine and my true love has wrought many wondrous works of fame and hath ridden the flaming fire withal while thy husband was but the thrall of king hjalprek ' and little it beseems thee of all folk to mock him who was thy first beloved and fafnir he slew yea and he rode thy flaming fire whereas thou didst deem that he was gunnar the king and by thy side he lay and took from thine hand the ring andvari's loom 'i am minded to think that my father is mightier than thine and my true love has wrought many wondrous works of fame and hath ridden the flaming fire withal while thy husband was but the thrall of king hjalprek ' 'thou wouldst be wise if thou shouldst hold thy peace rather than revile my husband ' and fafnir he slew yea and he rode thy flaming fire whereas thou didst deem that he was gunnar the king and by thy side he lay and took from thine hand the ring andvari's loom 'then brynhild saw the ring and knew it and waxed as wan as a dead woman ' 'ah yea said sigurd and where in all the world was she then when she said that she deemed she had the noblest of all men and the dearest to her heart of all ' 'with naught but evil intent thou sayest this for a cruel heart thou hast ' ask such things only as are good for thee to know matters meet for mighty dames good to love good things when all goes according to thy heart's desire 'saw the ring and knew it and waxed as wan as a dead woman' so when sigurd came to bed to gudrun she asked him why brynhild's joy was so departed 'nowise will i hide from thee that i deem no good of grimhild ' 'ah she is the beginning of all this hale that biteth know thereof overwell ' 'with naught but evil intent thou sayest this for a cruel heart thou hast ' ask such things only as are good for thee to know matters meet for mighty dames good to love good things when all goes according to thy heart's desire 'no secret speech had we ' 'sigurd slew fafnir and that only deed is of more worth than all the might of king gunnar ' 'nowise will i hide from thee that i deem no good of grimhild ' 'ah she is the beginning of all this hale that biteth so an evil drink she bare to sigurd so that he had no more memory of my very name ' 'she sleeps not' 'her heart is dealing rather with dreadful intent against me' 'well may it be that that shall come to heart against thee but thou hast him for husband whom thou didst choose ' 'i wondered at the man who came into my hall ' 'because of the veil that lay heavy on my fortune ' 'never looked i at gunnar in such a wise that my heart smiled on him ' 'and hard and fell am i to him though i hide it from others ' 'this is the sorest sorrow to me that the bitter sword is not reddened in thy blood ' 'naught do i heed my life or death ' 'but well i see how things stand for this has brynhild stirred thee up to and surely shall her counsel drag us into huge shame and scathe ' 'even she who loves me before all men' 'and now if i had been forewarned and had been afoot with my weapons then should many a man have lost his life or ever i had fallen and all those brethren should have been slain and a harder work would the slaying of me have been than the slaying of the mightiest bull or the mightiest boar of the wild wood' 'ah in the days by gone great mirth in the homefield when my sigurd set saddle on grani and they went their ways for the wooing of brynhild ' 'none but atli brought bale upon us my very brother born of budli when we saw in the hall of the hunnish people the gold a gleaming on the kingly giukings ' from the eyes of brynhild budli's daughter flashed out fire and she snorted forth venom as the sore wounds she gazed on of the dead slain sigurd 'ah in the days by gone great mirth in the homefield when my sigurd set saddle on grani and they went their ways for the wooing of brynhild ' 'may the woman lack both love and children who gained greeting for thee o gudrun ' 'none but atli brought bale upon us my very brother born of budli ' 'when we saw in the hall of the hunnish people the gold a gleaming on the kingly giukings ' 'i have paid for that faring oft and full and for the sight that then i saw ' 'son of three winters whom brynhild had let slay and guttorm withal ' 'and then died brynhild and was burned there by the side of sigurd ' until they wended for brynhild's wooing 'brynhild to me is better than all the child of budli is the best of women ' 'brynhild to me is better than all the child of budli is the best of women ' yea and my life will i lay down ere i am twinned from that woman's treasure 'to rend with sword oaths once sworn oaths once sworn and troth once plighted ' that maiden loved me far before all men yet wrong to gunnar i never wrought brotherhood i heeded and all bounden oaths that none should deem me his queen's darling 'and so folk say that brynhild drave in her chariot down along the way to hell ' 'more seemly for thee to sit sewing the cloth than to go look on the love of another ' 'golden girl hast thou not if thou listest to hearken in sweet wise from thy hands the blood of men washen ' 'nay blame me naught bride of the rock hall though i roved a warring in the days that were ' 'the higher of us twain shall i ever be holden when of our kind men make account ' thou o brynhild budli's daughter wert the worst ever born into the world for giuki's children death hast thou gotten and turned to destruction their goodly dwelling 'whereof overwrath waxed odin with me ' 'and bade me strewn with treasure two at the head and two at the feet two hounds therewith and two hawks moreover ' 'then is all dealt with even dealing ' 'when we both together into one bed went and were called by the name of man and wife ' never then belike shall clash behind him valhall's bright door with rings bedight yea and my fosterer and my father's dower that budli of old days gave to his dear child bane of all trees burning aloft and ruled that he only thereover should ride who should bring me the gold o'er which fafnir brooded 'in peace did we sleep soft in one bed as though he had been naught erst when we both together into one bed went and were called by the name of man and wife ' never then belike shall clash behind him valhall's bright door with rings bedight and if my fellowship followeth after in no wretched wise then shall we wend for him shall follow my five bondmaids my eight bondsmen no borel folk yea and my fosterer and my father's dower that budli of old days gave to his dear child yet thence blamed me gudrun giuki's daughter that i had slept in the arms of sigurd 'ah for unrest all too long are men and women made me they have gotten those heirs of giuki a loveless life a life of lies ' ah nothing seemly for sigurd to rule giuki's house and the folk of the goths when of him five sons for the slaying of men eager for battle should have been begotten 'then upon grani rode the goodly gold strewer to where my fosterer ruled his fair dwelling he who alone there was deemed best of all ' 'good weal shall ye have of weapons and lands that sigurd alone would surely have ruled if he had lived but a little longer ' ah nothing seemly for sigurd to rule giuki's house and the folk of the goths when of him five sons for the slaying of men eager for battle should have been begotten fragments of the lay of brynhild hogni said 'what hath wrought sigurd of any wrong doing that the life of the famed one thou art fain of taking ' ah nothing seemly for sigurd to rule giuki's house and the folk of the goths when of him five sons for the slaying of men eager for battle should have been begotten naught may i grimhild seek after gladness nor deem aught hopeful of any high warrior since wolf and raven were friends together the greedy the cruel o'er great sigurd's heart blood 'but brynhild he bade to the helm to betake her and said that death chooser she should become and that no better might ever be born into the world if fate would not spoil it ' 'then was war waged with the welsh wrought sword and the burg all broken that brynhild owned ' 'hard and dreadful was the vengeance she drew down so that all we have woe enow through all lands of the world shall that story fare forth how she did her to death for the death of sigurd ' 'but brynhild he bade to the helm to betake her and said that death chooser she should become and that no better might ever be born into the world if fate would not spoil it ' 'and she sat her down the sorrowful woman to tell of the bale and the heavy trouble ' 'brynhild he bade to the helm to betake her and said that death chooser she should become ' 'through all lands of the world shall that story fare forth how she did her to death for the death of sigurd ' 'then atli said that i surely never would fall to crime or shameful folly ' 'for brynhild sent his serving folk wide through the murkwood proof to win of me '",

wilder'd queen 'where's the king what portent is this what semblance fine he was but now beside me who snatch'd his hand from mine ' 'of over haste in parting i beg thee well beware ' sieglind and

beat higher at the view ' 'from time to time queen brunhild with searching glances eyed the love enkindling kriemhild lovely she was indeed ' then thus began fair kriemhild 'my husband's of such might that surely o'er these kingdoms he ought to rule by right ' thereto rejoin'd fair kriemhild 'see'st thou how proud he stands how proud he stalks conspicuous among those warrior bands as doth the moon far beaming the glimmering stars outshine sure have i cause to pride me when such a knight is mine ' thereto rejoin'd fair kriemhild 'so worthy is my mate all praise that i can give the warriors display'd their skill and force the good host with his comrades himself would run a course ' 'now came the noble kriemhild begirt with many a knight ' out then spake fair kriemhild full of wrath was

queen again 'so call i thee ' said kriemhild 'ay 'was not my brother that first thy favors won ' 'of my good name and honor than life more dear would fain thy cruel sister rob me to thee i needs must

seen how faithful her heart was and how true e'en to her day of dying her life in woe she pass'd she took for her slain siegfried a dread revenge at last 'so after her bereavement she sat for three long years and half another ever in sorrow and in tears nor once spoke word to gunther albeit in blood so nigh nor on her foeman hagan ever once set eye ' lovingly kiss'd he kriemhild and sadly thus 'gan say when he could see too clearly that she was fix'd to stay 'now home bereav'd and joyless a weary way we go 'tis only now i'm feeling the fulness of my woe ' then gently spoke prince gernot and heav'd full many a sigh 'god in heaven is my witness nor part the guilt had i in the death of siegfried nor had i heard before that any him 'bore malice i sorrow for him sore ' 'at worms still heard was kriemhild complaining day by day that none her sorrow pitied or brought her comfort due save giselher her brother he still was good and true ' 'soon kriemhild took full vengeance and woe repaid with woe ' queen uta and her ladies to sooth the mourner sought but still take could she never the comfort that they brought the sting of deadly sorrow had pierc'd her heart too deep 'vi so after her bereavement she sat for three long years and half another ever in sorrow and in tears ' viii 'we'll try ' replied king gunther 'my brothers with her bide perhaps by their persuasion she may be pacified and e'en in our possession the hoard contented see ' xi said she 'who charges gunther 'twas hagan struck the blow he gain'd from me the secret where steel could lay him low ' and had their charge delivered into fair kriemhild's hand when gernot and young giselher had thus possession gain'd of that power giving treasure the rule they straight obtain'd of the country and the castles and many a warlike knight when they had brought the treasure thence to king gunther's land and had their charge delivered into fair kriemhild's hand 'forthwith began sad kriemhild her heavy loss to plain' of my person and possessions thou should'st the guardian be 'thereat to him fair kriemhild yet deadlier hatred bore ' with this new weight of anguish surcharg'd was kriemhild left of her bold husband widow'd and of the hoard bereft nor ever ceas'd to sorrow e'en till her dying day 'from the death of siegfried for thirteen years she dwelt on her wrongs ever brooding nor joy one moment felt ' the murder of her husband she could not once forget to him she still was faithful that praise is kriemhild's yet 'a thousand fold more sorrow at her heart there lay the proud and high born lady would

strangers 'tis all in vain to fly your lives are pledg'd to kriemhild and take them now will i to his train shouted dankwart loud o'er the crash and din 'ye see bold squires and yeomen what danger hems us in fight for your lives ye friendless in sooth we're foully shent for all the loving greetings that fraudful kriemhild sent ' now god reward thee iring a noble knight thou art thou hast reviv'd my courage and comforted my heart on hagan's blood stain'd armor through thy bold deed i look 'and vengeance breathing kriemhild to fight together drew' when on her nearest kinsmen and many a noble knight dame kriemhild wreak'd the anguish that long in heart she bore they begg'd the huns king etzel to bring before the hall themselves then blood bedabbled and harness stain'd withal with the three royal brethren from th' house mov'd faint and slow to whom to plain they knew not in their o'ermastering woe 'for that you all must suffer ' 'to us my sister kriemhild a fatal feast has given ' 'away with thee base babbler ' thus the good margrave spake 'here have i pain and trouble enough my heart to break and thou too must revile me as here i would not fight these guests i should with reason have held in high despite who gifts so good and gorgeous to homeless how cruel and unfriendly 'twill to the world appear for more than on all others on you i still relied and took through such affiance your daughter for my bride 'sir knight in mind and body heaven keep thee ever blessed by thee all my long sorrows are shut up in delight ever if death prevent not thy service i'll requite ' 'let not her boast of gain in that by her contrivance this noble chief was slain ' said she 'ill hast thou quitted a debt so deadly scored at least in my possession i'll keep my siegfried's sword ' 'like kriemhild at st xxxi tenth adventure' 'full brighter was the shining of hire hewe than in the tower the noble yforged newe ' i do not know what authority the writer of 'murray's handbook for northern germany' has for the following statement 'the combat between chrimhelda and brunhelda is supposed to have been fought on the south side of the dom ' 'kriemhild is not a witness on oath but a woman in a frenzy of grief who does not weigh her words but one moment utters an obvious suspicion as if it were an ascertained fact and the next confesses that she has no positive proof and cannot act upon what she feels to be true ' the last verse of this stanza seems a preparation for the display of kriemhild's character in a new point of view the softer parts of her character have been exhibited thus far her revengeful and unforgiving spirit will gradually swallow up every other feeling and at last close the poem with a general massacre 'where have you that bestowed ' 'this stanza which is only found in the lassberg and two other manuscripts seems to have been inserted like several others in order to soften the ferocious character attributed to kriemhild in the latter part of the poem ' 'etzel and kriemhild were present in the hall' kriemhild's exhortation at st xx not to let the burgundians come _fur den sal_ kriemhild's exhortation at st xx not to let the burgundians

in other poems is not noticed in this was in the vicinity ' save that there was weeping for friends belov'd so well knights and squires dames and damsels were seen lamenting all so here i end my story this is the nibelungers' fall 'according to professor lachmann this poem has no title in most of the manuscripts in the two that have a superscription it is styled the book of kriemhild ' 'the rose garden of kriemhild which though celebrated in other poems is not noticed in this ' 'kriemhild who was in the habit of going to matins before daybreak took her way to the minster ' 'when he meets her in hungary' 'kriemhild was in the habit of going to the minster before daybreak ' 'the same simile is applied to kriemhild herself at st xx fifth adventure ' brunhild had been asserting that siegfried was gunther's vassal or in feudal language his man kriemhild sarcastically alludes to this with more bitterness than delicacy 'the same simile is applied to kriemhild herself at st xx fifth adventure ' 'kriemhild sarcastically alludes to this with more bitterness than delicacy ' 'kriemhild was in the habit of going to the minster before daybreak ' 'kriemhild sarcastically alludes to this with more bitterness than delicacy ' a and b are at the bottom of this if i could only bring it home to them i'd make them smart for it 'she' 'kriemhild here deals with bl\u0153del as juno does in the iliad with sleep and in the \u00e6neid with \u0153olus ' 'something seems defective here for it is not explained what bad object kriemhild had in view in sending for her son though it so happened that mischief came of it ' von der hagen and vollmer mention the account in the vilkina saga according to which kriemhild in order to set the huns and burgundians by the ears told her son to strike hagan in the face and hagan returned the compliment by cutting off the lad's head and throwing it into his mother's lap 'kriemhild here deals with bl\u0153del as juno does in the iliad with sleep and in the \u00e6neid with \u0153olus ' 'von der hagen and vollmer mention the account in the vilkina saga according to which kriemhild in order to set the huns and burgundians by the ears told her son' 'there certainly seems some confusion here the only people who had injured gunther in hungary were the huns who had massacred the yeomen and these were not present in the hall if on the other hand he suspected that the huns in the hall were privy to it why allow etzel and kriemhild to depart without so much as an observation ' 'the only people who had injured gunther in hungary were the huns who had massacred the yeomen and these were not present in the hall if on the other hand he suspected that the huns in the hall were privy to it why allow etzel and kriemhild to depart without so much as

began' 'the 7 000 huns massacred here are no doubt the same as the 7 000 who accompanied kriemhild to church at st xx thirty first adventure and the same perhaps as the men of kriemhild mentioned at

many a year but now i've met with something by which the thief to guess ' 'twas of silk of nineveh the girdle that she brought with precious stones well garnish'd a better ne'er was wrought 'that ring was stolen from me who held it dear ' 'and mischievously hidden has since been many a year ' what infamy his sister has forc'd me to endure and how his wife she voices for siegfried's paramour 'of my good name and honor than life more dear would fain thy cruel sister rob me ' to thee i needs must plain she says her husband siegfried my virgin favors won ' 'my long lost girdle she weareth as in scorn ' my gold adorns her finger would i had ne'er been born 'is not all this an outrage to sting and wound me sore ' for it i have far'd badly he beat me black and blue 'he should not pay the

than delicacy ' 'the combat between chrimhelda and brunhelda is supposed to have been fought on the south side of the dom ' 'brunhild seems as much annoyed by this usurpation of her trinkets as by the scandalous imputation mentioned in the preceding stanza ' 'the combat between chrimhelda and brunhelda is supposed to have been fought on the south side of the dom ' 'brunhild seems as much annoyed by

righteous man having thus spoken she entered the blazing fire ' 'she falls fainting on the ground and when she recovers her consciousness sheds some natural tears and bewails her cruel and undeserved

lord and guide and what seems good unto him she should do even at the cost of her life ' 'but sita s heart was too full this second ordeal was beyond even her power to submit to and the poet rose above the ordinary hindu level of women when he ventured to paint her conscious purity as rebelling beholding all the spectators and clothed in red garments sita clasping her hands and bending low her face spoke thus in a voice choked with tears as i even in mind have never thought of any other than rama so may madhavi the goddess of earth grant me a hiding place ' 'sita ' 'the twin sons of rama

the crow and bright mark pressed upon her brow when none was nigh but she and thou ' 'let thy words impart their gentle dew to cool my heart ' ah 'tis the crown of woe to see this gem and ask where where is she 'no more the light of beauty shines from sita as she weeps and pines ' 'her moonlight glory dim and shroud ' 'o speak dear hanuman and tell each word that from her sweet lips fell ' 'her words her words alone can give the healing balm to make me live ' 'no more the light of beauty shines from sita as she weeps and pines ' her dainty waist is round and slight her cheek like autumn's moon is bright and she like fruit in graven gold mocks her whom maya framed of old 'disdainful still my love she spurns still from each prayer and offering turns yet in all lands beneath the sun no dame may rival sita none her dainty waist is round and slight her cheek like autumn s moon is bright and she like fruit in graven gold mocks her 921 whom maya framed of old ' o'er sita's will let thine prevail 'and strength achieve if flattery fail ' 'fair punjikasthala 922 i met when radiant as a flame of fire she sought the palace of the sire ' awed by the threat of vengeance still i force not sita's stubborn will 'there prisoned by the giant lies my lady of the tender eyes ' 'pale wasted weeping on the ground the melancholy queen he found ' 'pale wasted weeping on the ground the melancholy queen he found ' 'pale wasted weeping on the ground the melancholy queen he found whose thoughts in utmost stress of ill were fixed upon her husband still ' 'see rudely stained with dust and red with dropping blood the severed head then turning to a rakshas slave the ruthless king his mandate gave and straight vidyujjihva who bore the head still wet with dripping gore the arrows and the mighty bow bent down before his master low vidyujjihva cried ravan place the head before the lady s face and let and he and all his legions wait embattled close to lanka s gate ' 'what wilt thou sita with the dead ' 'she gazed upon the head he showed' 'she gazed upon his cheek and brows' 'the features of her lord she knew' then first a faithful woman's eyes see sorrow 'then first a faithful woman s eyes see sorrow when her husband dies ' 'when thou my lord wast nigh to save some stealthy hand thy death wound gave ' 'and hast thou sought in heaven a place amid the founders of thy race where in the home deserved so well thy sires and dasaratha dwell ' 'or dost thou shine a brighter star in skies where blest immortals are forsaking in thy lofty scorn the race wherein thy sires were born ' 'turn to my gaze o turn thine eye why are thy cold lips silent why ' 'thy fate and mine the queen will know and broken hearted die of woe ' 'for my unworthy sake for mine rama the glory of his line ' 'who bridged his way across the main is basely in a puddle slain and i the graceless wife he wed have brought this ruin on his head ' 'me too on him o ravan slay the wife beside her husband lay ' 'by his dear body let me rest cheek close to cheek and breast to breast my happy eyes' 'the queen of fortune holds thee dear' 'and free his lady from her woe ' 'soon will his breast support thy head and tears of joy thine eyes will shed ' 'and rama meet for highest bliss will gain his guerdon in thy kiss ' 'there there in deep affliction lies my darling with the fawn like eyes ' low on the earth her rama lies and dark in death are lakshman's eyes 'bring forth my car and let her ride to view the chieftains side by side ' 'then from all doubt and terror free her softening heart will turn to me ' when on the pair her eyes she bent burst from her lips a wild lament her eyes o'erflowed she groaned and sighed and thus in trembling accents cried false are they all proved false to day the prophets of my fortune they who in the tranquil time of old a blessed life for me foretold predicting i should never know a childless dame's a widow's woe false are they all their words are vain for thou my lord and life art slain 'a queen like sita i may find among the best of womankind ' 'a queen like sita i may find among the best of womankind ' fear not in ravan's house to stay for good vibhishan now bears sway for constant truth and friendship known regard his palace as thine own so fast the flood of rapture came my trembling tongue no words could frame ne'er have i heard in days of bliss a tale that gave such joy as this 'sweet are the words o queen which thou true to thy lord hast spoken now better than gems and pearls of price yea or the throne of paradise ' 'lady at length my task is done and thou the prize of war art won this arm my glory has retrieved and all that man might do achieved ' 'queen sita of the lovely brows is lakshmi thy celestial spouse ' 'on sita then he looked and smiled list to my words he said dear child let not thy gentle breast retain one lingering trace of wrath or pain ' 'a glance on all the vanars threw and wistful eyes on rama bent as still she held the ornament ' 'this calm retreat she gives birth to two boys who receive the names of kusa and lava ' 'but she resolves to live for the sake of rama and her unborn son ' a friend's delight graced sita's offspring with each holy rite 'then spoke the king himself and bade them say who was their teacher whose the wondrous lay soon as valmiki mighty saint he saw he bowed his head in reverential awe these are thy children cried the saint recall thine own dear sita pure and true through all ' 'sita daughter of janak king of mithila ' 'sita daughter of janak king of mithila ' 'sita daughter of janak king of mithila ' 'sita daughter of janak king of mithila ' 'sita daughter of janak king of mithila ' 'sita daughter of janak king of mithila ' 'hanuman thus addressed by the great souled son of raghu related to the son of raghu all that sita had said '",

long arm if it is minded to save a man and if it were me i should not care how much i suffered before getting home provided i could be safe when i was once there ' 'mentor ' answered telemachus 'do not let us talk about it any more there is no chance of my father's ever coming back the gods have long since counselled his destruction ' on this minerva said 'telemachus what are you talking about heaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a man and if it were me i should not care how much i suffered before getting home provided i could be safe when i was once there i would rather this than get home quickly and then be killed in my own house as agamemnon was by the treachery of aegisthus and his wife ' 'make haste to do as i shall bid you i wish first and foremost to propitiate the great

in their beauty ' 'she came towards him in the likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher ' 'then minerva said yes father stranger i will show you the house you want for alcinous lives quite close to my own father ' 'for the great goddess minerva in her good will towards him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness ' 'minerva said this is the house father stranger which you would have me show you ' 'minerva said this is the house father stranger which you would have me show you you will find a number of great people sitting at table but do not be afraid go straight in for the bolder a man is the more likely he is to carry his point even though he is a stranger ' 'then minerva came up to him disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien with a good cloak folded double about her shoulders she had sandals on her comely feet and held a javelin in her hand ' minerva answered 'stranger you must be very simple or must have come from somewhere a long way off not to know what country this is it is a very celebrated place and everybody knows it east and west ' minerva answered 'never mind about him i sent him that he might be well spoken of for having gone ' i do not much think they will succeed but rather that some of those who are now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves ' she found him and pisistratus sleeping in the forecourt of menelaus's house 'minerva went close up to him and said ' 'telemachus you should not remain so far away from home any longer nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house they will eat up everything you have among them and you will have been on a fool's errand ' this made minerva still more furious so she scolded ulysses very angrily 173 'ulysses ' said she 'your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you fought for ' mentor she said do not let ulysses beguile you into siding with him and fighting the suitors this is what we will do when we have killed these people father and son we will kill you too you shall pay for it with your head and when we have killed you we will take all you have in doors or out and bring it into hotch pot with ulysses property we will not let your sons live in your house nor your daughters nor shall your widow continue to live in the city of ithaca ' ' ulysses said she your strength and prowess are no longer what they were when you fought for nine long years among the trojans about the noble lady helen you killed many a man in those days and it was through your stratagem that priam s city was taken how comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are on your own ground face to face with the suitors in your own house come on my good fellow stand by my side and see how mentor son of alcimus shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred upon him ' 'but she would not give him full victory as yet for she wished still further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son so she flew up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in the form of a swallow ' 'my child why should you ask me was it not by your own arrangement that ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors do whatever you like but i will tell you what i think will be most reasonable arrangement now that ulysses is revenged let them swear to a solemn covenant in virtue of which he shall continue to rule while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of their sons and brothers let them then all become friends as heretofore and let peace and plenty reign ' 'on this minerva came close up to him and said son of arceisius best friend i have in the world pray to the blue eyed damsel and to jove her father then poise your spear and to avenge the murder' on this

upon the front line of the foe and smote them with their swords and spears indeed they would have killed every one of them and prevented them from ever getting home again only minerva raised her voice aloud and made every one pause ' 'men of ithaca ' she cried 'cease this dreadful war and settle the matter at once without further bloodshed ' but ulysses gave a great cry and gathering himself together swooped down like a soaring eagle then the son of saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire that fell just in front of minerva so she said to ulysses 'ulysses noble son of laertes stop this warful

given when rama to the woods is driven when not a rival copes with me from chains of duty thou art free ' 'to sage sumantra thus began the king absorbed in joyful thought for his dear son no rest has sought sleepless to him the night has past and now o erwatched he sinks at last then go sumantra and with speed the glorious rama hither lead go as i pray nor longer wait no time is this to hesitate '

She met Rama during one such visit to the forest of Panchavati and was instantly smitten by his youthful good looks. Rama meanwhile kindly rejected her advances, telling her that he was faithful to his wife Sita and thus would never take another wife. Rejected, Shurpanakha then approached his younger brother, Lakshmana, who also rejected her, the humiliated and envious Shurpanakha attacked Sita but was thwarted by Lakshmana, who cut off her nose and ears and sent her back to Lanka .",

        "canto xxxiii the people's lament kausalya is mentioned as being affected by the people's lament canto xliii kausalya's lament 'the queen kausalya with delighted mien with reverent steps around him paced and with sweet wreaths the victim graced ' 'with calm and steady heart was fain by the dead charger s side to stay from evening till the break of day ' quick to the ladies' bower he sped and thus to queen kausalya said 'this genial nectar take and quaff' 'may fortune never leave thy side o mighty king with justice reign and still thy people s love retain ' 'then shone the son kausalya bore ' long be thy life my darling now thy prostrate foes before thee bow live long and with thy bright success my friends and dear sumitra's bless 'when thee sweet son thy mother bare that thy good gifts such love inspire and win the favour of thy sire ' 'scorned by thee in thy bliss and pride kausalya was of old defied ' 'fond king kausalya by thy side' 'ah he who ever freely did his duty ere his sire could bid our refuge and our sure defence this day will go an exile hence he on kausalya loves to wait most tender and affectionate ' 'first shall my feet the forest tread the flames shall first surround my head my might shall chase thy grief and tears as darkness flies when morn appears do thou dear queen and rama too behold what power like mine can do ' 'ah what to me were life and bliss condemned my darling son to miss but with my rama near to eat the very grass itself were sweet but if thou still wilt go and leave thy hapless mother here to grieve i from that hour will food abjure nor life without my son endure ' 'o queen unsanctioned tread this righteous path by duty led ' 'more dear my son one hour with thee than all the world where thou art not ' 'can he a stranger yet to pain whose pleasant words all hearts enchain son of the king and me the queen live on the grain his hands may glean can he whose slaves and menials eat the finest cakes of sifted wheat can rama in the forest live on roots and fruit which woodlands give who will believe who will not fear when the sad story smites his ear that one so dear so noble held is by the king his sire expelled now surely none may fate resist which orders all as it may list if rama in thy strength and grace the woods become thy dwelling place a childless mother long i grieved and many a sigh for offspring heaved with wistful longing weak and worn till thou at last my son wast born fanned by the storm of that desire deep in my soul i felt the fire whose offerings flowed from weeping eyes with fuel fed of groans and sighs while round the flame the smoke grew hot of tears because thou camest not now reft of thee too fiery fierce the flame of woe my heart will pierce as when the days of spring return the sun s hot beams the forest burn the mother cow still follows near the wanderings of her youngling dear so close to thine my feet shall be where er thou goest following thee ' 'kausalya by her son addressed with love and passion sore distressed afflicted with her eyes bedewed to rama thus her speech renewed ' 'nay rama but my heart will break if with these queens my home i make lead me too with thee let me go and wander like a woodland roe ' 'the highest bliss shalt thou obtain when i from exile come again ' 'thou wilt return thy duty done thy vows discharged high glory won ' 'go strong of arm go forth my boy go forth again to come with joy ' 'and thine expectant mother cheer with those sweet tones she loves to hear ' 'to me thy mother and thy sire ' 'with reverence to kausalya show my mother worn with eld and woe ' 'by duty s law o best of dames high worship from thy love she claims nor to the other queens refuse observance rendering each her dues ' 'then queen kausalya spake at last with loving arms about her cast pressed lingering kisses on her head and to the high souled lady said ' 'to his right hand kausalya went and ready aid the lady lent while bharat s loving mother tried to raise him on the other side ' place me by kausalya's side there only there my heart may know some little respite from my woe and place me by kausalya's side 'to queen kausalya s bower' 'then came the night whose hated gloom fell on him like the night of doom at midnight dasaratha cried to queen kausalya by his side i see thee not kausalya lay thy gentle hand in mine i pray ' place me by kausalya's side there only there my heart may know some little respite from my woe and for her banished son distressed with these sad words her lord addressed 'kaikeyi cruel false and vile has cast the venom of her guile on rama lord of men and she will ravage like a snake set free and more and more my soul alarm like a dire serpent bent on harm for triumph crowns each dark intent and rama to the wild is sent ' and place me by kausalya's side 'ah how will fare the exiles now whom moved by queen kaikeyi thou hast sent in forests to abide bred in delights by woe untried ' 'o that my years of woe were passed and the glad hour were come at last when i shall see my children dear rama his wife and lakshman here ' 'how thy happy eyes will brim with tears of joy to look on him thou blameless lady shouldst the whole of the sad people here console why in thy tender heart allow this bitter grief to harbour now as the long banks of cloud distil their water when they see the hill so shall the drops of rapture run from thy glad eyes to see thy son returning as he lowly bends to greet thee girt by all his friends thus soothing kindly eloquent with every hopeful argument kausalya s heart by sorrow rent fair queen sumitra ceased ' 'no guardian has kausalya now o be her friend and guardian thou ' 'she for her child no toil would spare tending me long with pain and care now in the hour of fruitage she has lost that son ah woe is me ' 'no guardian has kausalya now o be her friend and guardian thou ' 'no guardian has kausalya now o be her friend and guardian thou ' kausalya with sumitra's aid raised from the ground her lord dismayed sire of high fate she cried o why dost thou no single word reply to rama's messenger who brings news of his painful wanderings the great injustice done art thou shame stricken for thy conduct now rise up and do thy part bestow comfort and help in this our woe speak freely king dismiss thy fear for queen kaikeyi stands not near afraid of whom thou wouldst not seek tidings of rama freely speak 'she bids him as she roams declare the names of towns and hamlets there marks various trees that meet her eye and many a brook that hurries by and janak s daughter seems to roam one little league away from home when rama or his brother speaks and gives the answer that she seeks ' 'for rama s arm supports her still ' 'thus with persuasive art he tried to turn her from her grief aside by soothing fancies won but still she gave her sorrow vent ah rama was her shrill lament my love my son my son ' 'in sportive grace she walks the ground and sweet her chiming anklets sound ' 'again immersed in thought he eyed kausalya standing by his side ' 'kausalya for thy grace i sue joining these hands as suppliants do thou e en to foes hast ever been a gentle ' 'i know thy lips the truth must tell ' 'as from kausalya reasoning well' 'kausalya too the eldest queen who far foresees with insight keen did she not ever show thee all a sister s love at duty s call ' 'thou who hast made kausalya pure gentle affectionate endure the loss of him who was her bliss ' thus with his words he undeceived kausalya's troubled heart who grieved for son and husband reft away 'kausalya by her woe oppressed the senseless bharat s limbs caressed as a fond cow in love and fear caresses oft her youngling dear then yielding to her woe she said weeping and sore disquieted what torments o my son are these of sudden pain or swift disease ' 'kausalya by her woe oppressed the senseless bharat s limbs caressed as a fond cow in love and fear caresses oft her youngling dear then yielding to her woe she said weeping and sore disquieted what torments o my son are these of sudden pain or swift disease ' he whom kausalya bare whose might the foemen slays his line's delight she whom o saint thou seest here a goddess in her form appear was the chief consort of the king now worn with fast and sorrowing as aditi in days of yore the all preserving vishnu bore kausalya bore with happy fate lord rama of the lion's gait 'kausalya with her faded cheek and weeping eyes began to speak and thus in mournful tones addressed the queen sumitra and the rest see in the wood the bank s descent which the two orphan youths frequent whose noble spirits never fall though woes surround them reft of all thy son with love that never tires draws water hence which mine requires this day for lowly toil unfit his pious task thy son should quit ' so just and true thy generous soul thy hand may well this earth control but many a sage his aid will lend with counsellor and peer and friend with these advise their counsel ask and so perform thy arduous task the moon his beauty may forgo the cold forsake the hills of snow and ocean o'er his banks may sweep but i my father's word will keep 'o let not good kausalya shed her bitter tears to mourn me dead ' 'o dear kausalya 842 hear me cry ' 'ah lord and shall thy head recline on earth s cold breast forsaking mine counting her chill lap dearer far than i and my caresses are ' 'by his dear body let me rest cheek close to cheek and breast to breast my happy eyes i then will close and follow whither rama goes ' 'our homage to kausalya pay '",

grasped his warrior s mighty bow and clasped his quiver to his side with watchful eyes along the road the glorious saint agastya showed dauntless in fight the brothers strode and sita with them hied '

large store of venison of the buck or some great boar his hand has struck meanwhile o stranger grant my prayer thy name thy race thy birth declare and why with no companion thou roamest in dandak

' 'who wouldst pollute with impious touch the wife whom rama loves so much ' 'if thou refuse to hear my prayer of grief and coming woe beware ' 'she answered in that lonely place the monarch of the giant race ' 'o see the king who rules the race of giants cruel fierce and base ravan the spoiler bears me hence the helpless prey of violence ' 'o see the king who rules the race of giants cruel fierce and base ravan the spoiler bears me hence the helpless prey of violence ' 'where sita wept with shrill lament' 'enjoy my love and take thy rest ' 'o sita shalt thou ride delighted by thy lover

the vengeful blade she looks and longs for rama's face but sees a crowd of demon race and guarded by the giant's train pines for her lord and weeps in vain 'she on her woe will sadly brood and pine away in solitude ' 'she thought of rama far away she mourned for lakshman as she lay in grief and terror and dismay half fainting on the ground ' how may i know for truth that thou whose form i see before me now art verily the king adored by heavenly gods and sachi's lord 'o may no ill my spouse betide ' 'if sita lost my days i end and thou without me homeward wend ' 'those blood devouring demons all grieve in their souls for khara s fall and sita none to guard her side torn by their cruel hands has died ' 'o save me lakshman or i die ' 'if sita lost my days i end ' 'but if my wife have perished i reft of my love will surely die o lakshman if i seek my cot look for my love and find her not sweet welcome with her smile to give i tell thee i will cease to live ' 'lives sita yet or is she slain ' 'thus all his thoughts on sita bent ' 'she bade thee seek my side to aid and quickly was the hest obeyed but ah thy fault i needs must blame to leave alone the helpless dame and let the cruel giants sate the fury of their murderous hate those blood devouring demons all grieve in their souls for khara s fall and sita none to guard her side torn by their cruel hands has died ' 'she
