ABSTRACT:

The Archetypes of Female Characters in Literary Epics, and What They Mean for the Expectations from Women in a Culture Over Time, and in the Modern Context

The subject matter of this paper will cover a number of literary epics and the female characters represented in them, and view them through the lens of character archetypes as understood in the modern context. Given that epics contain social history(^1) of a culture, and are considered pieces of art, the concept of art imitates life and life imitates art is explored in order to determine whether the socio-cultural expectations of women stem from ‘role-models’ modelled by the (mostly male) writers of these epics. The idea of how much this affects their internal idea of self is also explored in the latter half through concept of the male gaze in epics.

To do this, the main material treated as ‘data’ will be the text of these epics by themselves, and it will be explored by using machine learning algorithms as well as analyzing some epic text, and the works of scholars on these texts. A model will be developed to explore the ‘proximity’ of different characters to each other in order to better understand the features of a character that give them certain archetypes. I have chosen this topic in order to explore the claims that the events that set off the actions in Ramayana, Mahabharata, Iliad, and many other epics all revolve around female characters. 

The project aims to shed light on the invisible structures that affect the way women view themselves and cater their behavior to.(^2) The final outcome of this project will be a data story created with the help of d3.js and other data visualization techniques, in order to create a discovery tool for these characters.

2: “Male fantasies, male fantasies, is everything run by male fantasies? Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it's all a male fantasy: that you're strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it. Even pretending you aren't catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else. You are a woman with a man inside watching a woman. You are your own voyeur.” ― **Margaret Atwood, **The Robber Bride
