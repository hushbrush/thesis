ABSTRACT:

The Archetypes of Female Characters in Literary Epics, and What They Mean for the Expectations from Women in a Culture Over Time, and in the Modern Context

The subject matter of this paper will cover a number of literary epics and the female characters represented in them, and view them through the lens of character archetypes as understood in the modern context. Given that epics contain social history(^1) of a culture, and are considered pieces of art, the concept of art imitates life and life imitates art is explored in order to determine whether the socio-cultural expectations of women stem from ‘role-models’ modelled by the (mostly male) writers of these epics. The idea of how much this affects their internal idea of self is also explored in the latter half through concept of the male gaze in epics.

To do this, the main material treated as ‘data’ will be the text of these epics by themselves, and it will be explored by using machine learning algorithms as well as analyzing some epic text, and the works of scholars on these texts. A model will be developed to explore the ‘proximity’ of different characters to each other in order to better understand the features of a character that give them certain archetypes. I have chosen this topic in order to explore the claims that the events that set off the actions in Ramayana, Mahabharata, Iliad, and many other epics all revolve around female characters. 

The project aims to shed light on the invisible structures that affect the way women view themselves and cater their behavior to.(^2) The final outcome of this project will be a data story created with the help of d3.js and other data visualization techniques, in order to create a discovery tool for these characters.

Up on a pedestal or down on your knees, it's all a male fantasy: that you're strong enough to take what they dish out, or else too weak to do anything about it. Even pretending you aren't catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else. You are a woman with a man inside watching a woman. You are your own voyeur.” ― **Margaret Atwood, **The Robber Bride

INTRODUCTION:



"The Historian and the Epic" defines epic
as "essentially a literary crystallisation of the
heroic ideal. By its very nature, therefore, it
is not to be taken as factual evidence, 
but as the representation of an
ideal." (Thapar 199) (^3)

But an ideal is contextualised by when, and where. What similarities will be uncovered when this context is removed? If we looked at the female characters in epics from all over the world, from the lens of today, where do these women fall in terms of the ‘ideal?’ 
This thesis aims to do exactly that, exploring the text of certain epics with the idea of archetypes at the centre of it, and trying to analyse the features of a character that make it a particular archetype. 

The word ‘archetype’ is Greek for ‘first imprint.’ More colloquially, it is used to cluster certain features and decisions made by characters in order to generalise the journey of characters. According to Carl Jung, there are 7 female archetypes- the Mother, the Maiden, the Queen, the Huntress, the Sage, the Mystic, and the Lover. Sita from Ramayana immediately seems to fall under the Mystic, while Kunti from the same falls under the Mother. But is this all that the characters were about? 

Piecing together the cultural extrapolation and power the epics have even today(^3), with the male gaze that is inevitably a part of the epics that are written by men will be addressed. By analysing the construction of female characters in the world of a man, the thesis will explore both the archetypes that emerge as well as how these portrayals shape and reinforce cultural expectations of women. Additionally, it will consider whether these literary ideals influence how women perceive and internalize their own roles within society, and then try to construct a ‘lineage’ of female characters through time and culture. 


While the data visualisation project will aim to deal with characters from several epics, this written thesis will focus on the relationship between a culture and the ‘ideal female characteristics’ through the characters of 3 epics: Mahabharata, Iliad, and The Tale of Genji. It will then focus on understanding the relationship of the female characters with their culture in a qualitative way, while the visualisation project will use the findings of this qualitative function to apply it on a broader scale and uncover ‘proximity’ of different characters from different cultures. Furthermore, it will also look into addressing the best practice to frame such a problem from the perspective of code. This will include a brief outline of the reasoning behind the chosen computational method for determining character proximity, reflecting on both its advantages and the limitations of alternative approaches. Since the nature of the problem makes it susceptible to multicollinearity through the origin of the archetype, methods to avoid this will be theorized.

Further, I argue that rather than being a dead-end, the epics and
their characters are fertile ground for the enunciation of multiple feminisms
and their various contradictions within the Indian context, and for the creation of common ground between feminists and Indian women at large.
